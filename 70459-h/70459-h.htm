<h2 class="nobreak">“<i>TO LET.</i>”</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“List, list, O list!”—<span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, <i>Act I</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, when I was a slim young spin,
I came out to India to live with my brother Tom:
he and I were members of a large and somewhat
impecunious family, and I do not think my mother
was sorry to have one of her four grown-up
daughters thus taken off her hands. Tom’s wife,
Aggie, had been at school with my eldest sister;
we had known and liked her all our lives, and
regarded her as one of ourselves; and as she and
the children were at home when Tom’s letter was
received, and his offer accepted, she helped me
to choose my slender outfit, with judgment, zeal,
and taste; endowed me with several pretty additions
to my wardrobe; superintended the fitting
of my gowns and the trying on of my hats, with
most sympathetic interest, and finally escorted me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
out to Lucknow, under her own wing, and installed
me in the only spare room in her comfortable
bungalow in Dilkousha.</p>

<p>My sister-in-law is a pretty little brunette, rather
pale, with dark hair, brilliant black eyes, a resolute
mouth, and a bright, intelligent expression.
She is orderly, trim, feverishly energetic, and
seems to live every moment of her life. Her
children, her wardrobe, her house, her servants,
and last, not least, her husband, are all models
in their way; and yet she has plenty of time for
tennis, and dancing, and talking and walking.
She is, undoubtedly, a remarkably talented little
creature, and especially prides herself on her
nerve, and her power of will, or will power. I
suppose they are the same thing? and I am sure
they are all the same to Tom, who worships the
sole of her small slipper. Strictly between ourselves,
she is the ruling member of the family, and
turns her lord and master round her little finger.
Tom is big and fair (of course), the opposite to his
wife, quiet, rather easy-going and inclined to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
indolent; but Aggie rouses him up, and pushes
him to the front, and keeps him there. She
knows all about his department, his prospects of
promotion, his prospects of furlough, of getting
acting appointments, and so on, even better than
he does himself. The chief of Tom’s department—have
I said that Tom is in the Irritation Office?—has
placed it solemnly on record that he considers
little Mrs. Shandon a surprisingly clever
woman. The two children, Bob and Tor, are
merry, oppressively active monkeys, aged three
and five years respectively. As for myself, I am
tall, fair—and I wish I could add pretty! but
this is a true story. My eyes are blue, my teeth
are white, my hair is red—alas, a blazing red;
and I was, at this period, nineteen years of age;
and now I think I have given a sufficient outline
of the whole family.</p>

<p>We arrived at Lucknow in November, when the
cold weather is delightful, and everything was
delightful to me. The bustle and life of a great
Indian station, the novelty of my surroundings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the early morning rides, picnics down the river,
and dances at the “Chutter Munzil,” made me
look upon Lucknow as a paradise on earth; and
in this light I still regarded it, until a great
change came over the temperature, and the month
of April introduced me to red-hot winds, sleepless
nights, and the intolerable “brain-fever” bird.
Aggie had made up her mind definitely on one
subject: we were not to go away to the hills until
the rains. Tom could only get two months’ leave
(July and August), and she did not intend to leave
him to grill on the plains alone. As for herself
and the children—not to speak of me—we had all
come out from home so recently that we did not
require a change. The trip to Europe had made a
vast hole in the family stocking, and she wished
to economize; and who can economize with two
establishments in full swing? Tell me this, ye
Anglo-Indian matrons? With a large, cool
bungalow, plenty of punkahs, khuskhus tatties,
ice, and a thermantidote, surely we could manage
to brave May and June—at any rate the attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
was made. Gradually the hills drained Lucknow
week by week; family after family packed up,
warned us of our folly in remaining on the plains,
offered to look for houses for us, and left by the
night mail. By the middle of May, the place was
figuratively empty. Nothing can be more dreary
than a large station in the hot weather—unless it
is an equally forsaken hill station in the depths
of winter, when the mountains are covered with
snow, the mall no longer resounds with gay voices
and the tramp of Jampanies, but is visited by
bears and panthers, and the houses are closed,
and, as it were, put to bed in straw! As for Lucknow
in the summer, it was a melancholy spot; the
public gardens were deserted, the chairs at the
Chutter Munzil stood empty, the very bands had
gone to the hills! the shops were shut, the baked
white roads, no longer thronged with carriages and
bamboo carts, gave ample room to the humble
ekka, or a Dhobie’s meagre donkey, shuffling along
in the dust.</p>

<p>Of course we were not the <i>only</i> people remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
in the place, grumbling at the heat and dust
and life in general; but there can be no sociability
with the thermometer above 100° in the shade.
Through the long, long Indian day we sat and
gasped, in darkened rooms, and consumed quantities
of “Nimbo pegs,” <i>i.e.</i> limes and soda-water,
and listened to the fierce hot wind roaring along
the road and driving the roasted leaves before it;
and in the evening, when the sun had set, we
went for a melancholy drive through the Wingfield
Park, or round by Martiniere College, and
met our friends at the library, and compared sensations
and thermometers. The season was exceptionally
bad (but people say that every year),
and presently Bobby and Tor began to fade: their
little white faces and listless eyes appealed to
Aggie as Tom’s anxious expostulations had never
done. “Yes, they must go to the hills with <i>me</i>.”
But this idea I repudiated at once; I refused to
undertake the responsibility—I, who could scarcely
speak a word to the servants—who had no experience!
Then Bobbie had a bad go of fever—intermittent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
fever; the beginning of the end
to his alarmed mother; the end being represented
by a large gravestone! She now became
as firmly determined to go, as she had previously
been resolved to stay; but it was so late in the
season to take a house. Alas, alas, for the beautiful
tempting advertisements in the <i>Pioneer</i>, which
we had seen and scorned! Aggie wrote to a friend
in a certain hill station, called (for this occasion
only) “Kantia,” and Tom wired to a house agent,
who triumphantly replied by letter, that there was
not <i>one</i> unlet bungalow on his books. This missive
threw us into the depths of despair; there
seemed no alternative but a hill hotel, and the
usual quarters that await the last comers, and
the proverbial welcome for children and dogs (we
had only four); but the next day brought us good
news from Aggie’s friend Mrs. Chalmers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Shandon</span> (she said),</p>

<p>“I received your letter, and went at once
to Cursitjee, the agent. Every hole and corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
up here seems full, and he had not a single house
to let. To-day I had a note from him, saying
that Briarwood is vacant; the people who took
it are not coming up, they have gone to Naini
Tal. You <i>are</i> in luck. I have just been out to
see the house, and have secured it for you. It is
a mile and a half from the club, but I know that
you and your sister are capital walkers. I envy
you. Such a charming place—two sitting-rooms,
four bedrooms, four bath-rooms, a hall, servants’
go-downs, stabling, and a splendid view from a very
pretty garden, and only Rs. 800 for the season!
Why, I am paying Rs. 1000 for a <i>very</i> inferior
house, with scarcely a stick of furniture and no
view. I feel so proud of myself, and I am longing
to show you my treasure-trove. Telegraph
when you start, and I shall have a milkman in
waiting and fires in all the rooms.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours sincerely,</span><br>

“<span class="smcap">Edith Chalmers</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>We now looked upon Mrs. Chalmers as our best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and dearest friend, and began to get under way
at once. A long journey in India is a serious business,
when the party comprises two ladies, two children,
two ayahs, and five other servants, three fox
terriers, a mongoose, and a Persian cat—all these
animals going to the hills for the benefit of their
health—not to speak of a ton of luggage, including
crockery and lamps, a cottage piano, a goat,
and a pony. Aggie and I, the children, one ayah,
two terriers, the cat and mongoose, our bedding
and pillows, the tiffin basket and ice basket, were
all stowed into one compartment, and I must
confess that the journey was truly miserable.
The heat was stifling, despite the water tatties.
One of the terriers had a violent dispute with the
cat, and the cat had a difference with the mongoose,
and Bob and Tor had a pitched battle;
more than once I actually wished myself back in
Lucknow. I was most truly thankful to wake one
morning, to find myself under the shadow of the
Himalayas—not a mighty, snow-clad range of everlasting
hills, but merely the spurs—the moderate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
slopes, covered with scrub, loose shale, and jungle,
and deceitful little trickling watercourses. We
sent the servants on ahead, whilst we rested
at the Dâk bungalow near the railway station,
and then followed them at our leisure. We accomplished
the ascent in dandies—open kind of
boxes, half box, half chair, carried on the
shoulders of four men. This was an entirely
novel sensation to me, and at first an agreeable
one, so long as the slopes were moderate, and
the paths wide; but the higher we went, the
narrower became the path, the steeper the naked
precipice; and as my coolies would walk at the
extreme edge, with the utmost indifference to my
frantic appeals to “Beetor! Beetor!”—and would
change poles at the most agonizing corners—my
feelings were very mixed, especially when droves
of loose pack ponies came thundering downhill,
with no respect for the rights of the road. Late
at night we passed through Kantia, and arrived
at Briarwood, far too weary to be critical. Fires
were blazing, supper was prepared, and we despatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it in haste, and most thankfully went
to bed and slept soundly, as any one would do
who had spent thirty-six hours in a crowded compartment,
and ten in a cramped wooden case.</p>

<p>The next morning, rested and invigorated, we
set out on a tour of inspection; and it is almost
worth while to undergo a certain amount of baking
in the sweltering heat of the lower regions, in order
to enjoy those deep first draughts of cool hill air,
instead of a stifling, dust-laden atmosphere; and
to appreciate the green valleys and blue hills, by
force of contrast to the far-stretching, eye-smarting,
white glaring roads, that intersect the burnt-up
plains—roads and plains, that even the pariah
abandons, salamander though he be!</p>

<p>To our delight and surprise, Mrs. Chalmers
had by no means overdrawn the advantages of
our new abode. The bungalow was solidly built
of stone, two-storied, and ample in size. It stood
on a kind of shelf, cut out of the hillside, and
was surrounded by a pretty flower garden, full of
roses, fuchsias, and carnations. The high road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
passed the gate, from which the avenue descended,
direct to the entrance door, at the end of
the house, and from whence ran a long passage.
Off this passage three rooms opened to the right,
all looking south, and all looking into a deep,
delightful, flagged, verandah. The stairs were
very steep. At the head of them, the passage
and rooms were repeated. There were small
nooks, and dressing-rooms, and convenient out-houses,
and plenty of good water; but the glory
of Briarwood was undoubtedly its verandah: it
was fully twelve feet wide, roofed with zinc,
and overhung a precipice of a thousand feet—not
a startlingly sheer khud, but a tolerably
straight descent of grey-blue shale, rocks, and low
jungle. From it there was a glorious view, across
a valley, far away, to the snowy range. It opened
at one end into the avenue, and was not inclosed;
but at the side next the precipice, there was a
stout wooden railing, with netting at the bottom,
for the safety of too enterprising dogs or children.
A charming spot, despite its rather bold situation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and as Aggie and I sat in it, surveying the
scenery and inhaling the pure hill air, and watching
Bob and Tor tearing up and down, playing
horses, we said to one another that “the verandah
alone was worth half the rent.”</p>

<p>“It’s absurdly cheap,” exclaimed my sister-in-law
complacently. “I wish you saw the hovel
<i>I</i> had, at Simla, for the same rent. I wonder if
it is feverish, or badly drained, or what?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it has a ghost,” I suggested facetiously;
and at such an absurd idea we both
went into peals of laughter.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Chalmers appeared, brisk,
rosy, and breathlessly benevolent, having walked
over from Kantia.</p>

<p>“So you have found it,” she said as we shook
hands. “I said nothing about this delicious
verandah! I thought I would keep it as a surprise.
I did not say a word too much for Briarwood,
did I?”</p>

<p>“Not half enough,” we returned rapturously;
and presently we went in a body, armed with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
list from the agent, and proceeded to go over the
house and take stock of its contents.</p>

<p>“It’s not a bit like a <i>hill</i> furnished house,”
boasted Mrs. Chalmers, with a glow of pride, as
she looked round the drawing-room; “carpets,
curtains, solid, <i>very</i> solid chairs, and Berlin wool-worked
screens, a card-table, and any quantity
of pictures.”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t they look like family portraits?”
I suggested, as we gazed at them. There was
one of an officer in faded water colours, another
of his wife, two of a previous generation in oils
and amply gilded frames, two sketches of an
English country house, and some framed photographs—groups
of grinning cricketers, or wedding
guests. All the rooms were well, almost handsomely,
furnished in an old-fashioned style. There
was no scarcity of wardrobes, looking-glasses, or
even armchairs, in the bedrooms, and the pantry
was fitted out—a most singular circumstance—with
a large supply of handsome glass and china,
lamps, old moderators, coffee and teapots, plated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
side dishes, and candlesticks, cooking utensils and
spoons and forks, wine coasters and a cake-basket.
These articles were all let with the house (much
to our amazement), provided we were responsible
for the same. The china was spode, the plate
old family heirlooms, with a crest—a winged
horse—on everything, down to the very mustard
spoons.</p>

<p>“The people who own this house must be
lunatics,” remarked Aggie, as she peered round
the pantry; “fancy hiring out one’s best family
plate, and good old china! And I saw some
ancient music-books in the drawing-room, and
there is a side saddle in the bottle khana.”</p>

<p>“My dear, the people who owned this house are
dead,” explained Mrs. Chalmers. “I heard all
about them last evening from Mrs. Starkey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is <i>she</i> up there?” exclaimed Aggie, somewhat
fretfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, her husband is cantonment magistrate.
This house belonged to an old retired colonel and
his wife. They and his niece lived here. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
were all their belongings. They died within a
short time of one another, and the old man left
a queer will, to say that the house was to remain
precisely as they left it for twenty years, and at
the end of that time, it was to be sold and all the
property dispersed. Mrs. Starkey says she is sure
that he never intended it to be <i>let</i>, but the heir-at-law
insists on that, and is furious at the terms
of the will.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a very good thing for us,” remarked
Aggie; “we are as comfortable here, as if we were
in our own house: there is a stove in the kitchen,
there are nice boxes for firewood in every room,
clocks, real hair mattresses—in short, it is as you
said, a treasure-trove.”</p>

<p>We set to work to modernize the drawing-room
with phoolkaries, Madras muslin curtains, photograph
screens and frames, and such-like portable
articles. We placed the piano across a corner,
arranged flowers in some handsome Dresden
china vases, and entirely altered and improved
the character of the room. When Aggie had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
despatched a most glowing description of our new
quarters to Tom, and when we had had tiffin, we set
off to walk into Kantia to put our names down at
the library, and to inquire for letters at the post-office.
Aggie met a good many acquaintances—who
does not, who has lived five years in India
in the same district?</p>

<p>Among them Mrs. Starkey, an elderly lady with
a prominent nose and goggle eyes, who greeted
her loudly across the reading-room table, in this
agreeable fashion:</p>

<p>“And so you have come up after <i>all</i>, Mrs.
Shandon. Some one told me that you meant
to remain below, but I knew you never could be
so wicked as to keep your poor little children in
that heat.” Then coming round and dropping
into a chair beside her, she said, “And I suppose
this young lady is your sister-in-law?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Starkey eyed me critically, evidently appraising
my chances in the great marriage
market. She herself had settled her own two
daughters most satisfactorily, and had now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
nothing to do, but interest herself in other
people’s affairs.</p>

<p>“Yes,” acquiesced Aggie; “Miss Shandon—Mrs.
Starkey.”</p>

<p>“And so you have taken Briarwood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have been most lucky to get it.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will think so, at the end of three
months,” observed Mrs. Starkey, with a significant
pursing of her lips. “Mrs. Chalmers is a stranger
up here, or she would not have been in such a
hurry to jump at it.”</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter with it?” inquired
Aggie. “It is well built, well furnished, well
situated, and very cheap.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it—<i>suspiciously</i> cheap. Why, my
dear Mrs. Shandon, if there was not something
against it, it would let for two hundred rupees a
month. Common sense would tell you that!”</p>

<p>“And what is against it?”</p>

<p>“It’s haunted! There you have the reason in
two words.”</p>

<p>“Is that all? I was afraid it was the drains.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
I don’t believe in ghosts and haunted houses.
What are we supposed to see?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” retorted Mrs. Starkey, who seemed
a good deal nettled at our smiling incredulity.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” with an exasperating laugh.</p>

<p>“No, but you will make up for it in hearing.
Not now—you are all right for the next six weeks—but
after the monsoon breaks, I give you a week
at Briarwood. No one would stand it longer, and
indeed you might as well bespeak your rooms at
Cooper’s Hotel <i>now</i>. There is always a rush up
here in July, by the two months’ leave people, and
you will be poked into some wretched go-down.”</p>

<p>Aggie laughed, rather a careless ironical little
laugh, and said, “Thank you, Mrs. Starkey; but
I think we will stay on where we are—at any
rate for the present.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will be as <i>you</i> please. What do
you think of the verandah?” she inquired, with
a curious smile.</p>

<p>“I think, as I was saying to Susan, that it is
worth half the rent of the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“And in <i>my</i> opinion the house is worth double
rent without it;” and with this enigmatic remark,
she rose, and sailed away.</p>

<p>“Horrid old frump!” exclaimed Aggie, as we
walked home in the starlight. “She is jealous
and angry that she did not get Briarwood <i>herself</i>—I
know her so well. She is always hinting, and
repeating stories about the nicest people—always
decrying your prettiest dress, or your best servant.”</p>

<p>We soon forgot all about Mrs. Starkey, and her
dismal prophecy, being too gay, and too busy, to
give her, or it, a thought. We had so many
engagements—tennis-parties and tournaments,
picnics, concerts, dances, and little dinners. We
ourselves gave occasional afternoon teas in the
verandah—using the best spode cups and saucers,
and the old silver cake-basket—and were warmly
complimented on our good fortune in securing such
a charming house and garden. One day the
children discovered, to their great joy, that the old
chowkidar belonging to the bungalow possessed
an African grey parrot—a rare bird indeed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
India; he had a battered Europe cage, doubtless
a remnant of better days, and swung on his ring,
looking up at us inquiringly, out of his impudent
little black eyes.</p>

<p>The parrot had been the property of the former
inmates of Briarwood, and as it was a long-lived
creature, had survived its master and mistress,
and was boarded out with the chowkidar, at one
rupee per month.</p>

<p>The chowkidar willingly carried the cage into the
verandah, where the bird seemed perfectly at home.</p>

<p>We got a little table for its cage, and the
children were delighted with him, as he swung to
and fro, with a bit of cake in his wrinkled claw.</p>

<p>Presently he startled us all by suddenly calling
“Lucy,” in a voice that was as distinct as if it
had come from a human throat. “Pretty Lucy—Lu—cy.”</p>

<p>“That must have been the niece,” said Aggie.
“I expect she was the original of that picture over
the chimney-piece in your room; she looks like
a Lucy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>It was a large, framed, half-length photograph of
a very pretty girl, in a white dress, with gigantic
open sleeves. The ancient parrot talked incessantly
now that he had been restored to society; he
whistled for the dogs, and brought them flying to
his summons—to his great satisfaction, and their
equally great indignation. He called “Qui hye”
so naturally, in a lady’s shrill soprano, or a gruff
male bellow, that I have no doubt our servants
would have liked to have wrung his neck. He
coughed and expectorated like an old gentleman,
and whined like a puppy, and mewed like a cat,
and, I am sorry to add, sometimes swore like a
trooper; but his most constant cry was, “Lucy,
where are you, pretty Lucy—Lucy—Lu—cy?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Aggie and I went to various picnics, but to that
given by the Chalmers (in honour of Mr. Chalmers’
brother Charlie, a captain in a Ghoorka regiment,
just come up to Kantia on leave) Aggie was unavoidably
absent. Tor had a little touch of fever,
and she did not like to leave him; but I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
under my hostess’s care, and expected to enjoy
myself immensely. Alas! on that selfsame afternoon,
the long-expected monsoon broke, and we
were nearly drowned! We rode to the selected spot,
five miles from Kantia, laughing and chattering,
indifferent to the big blue-black clouds that came
slowly, but surely, sailing up from below; it was
a way they had had for days, and nothing had
come of it! We spread the table-cloth, boiled the
kettle, unpacked the hampers, in spite of sharp
gusts of wind and warning rumbling thunder.
Just as we had commenced to reap the reward
of our exertions, there fell a few huge drops,
followed by a vivid flash, and then a tremendous
crash of thunder, like a whole park of artillery, that
seemed to shake the mountains—and after this
the deluge. In less than a minute we were soaked
through; we hastily gathered up the table-cloth
by its four ends, gave it to the coolies, and fled.
It was all I could do to stand against the wind;
only for Captain Chalmers I believe I would have
been blown away; as it was, I lost my hat, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
whirled into space. Mrs. Chalmers lost her boa,
and Mrs. Starkey, not merely her bonnet, but
some portion of her hair. We were truly in a
wretched plight, the water streaming down our
faces, and squelching in our boots; the little
trickling mountain rivulets were now like racing
seas of turbid water; the lightning was almost
blinding; the trees rocked dangerously, and lashed
one another with their quivering branches. I had
never been out in such a storm before, and sincerely
hope I never may again. We reached Kantia
more dead than alive, and Mrs. Chalmers sent an
express to Aggie, and kept me till the next day.
After raining as it only <i>can</i> rain in the Himalayas,
the weather cleared, the sun shone, and I rode
home in borrowed plumes, full of my adventures,
and in the highest spirits. I found Aggie sitting
over the fire in the drawing-room, looking ghastly
white: that was nothing uncommon; but terribly
depressed, which was most unusual.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have neuralgia?” I said, as I
kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>She nodded, and made no reply.</p>

<p>“How is Tor?” I inquired, as I drew a chair up
to the fire.</p>

<p>“Better—quite well.”</p>

<p>“Any news—any letter?”</p>

<p>“Not a word—not a line.”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened to Pip”—Pip was a
fox-terrier, renowned for having the shortest tail
and being the most impertinent dog in Lucknow—“or
the mongoose?”</p>

<p>“No, you silly girl! Why do you ask such
ridiculous questions?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid something was amiss; you seem
rather down on your luck.”</p>

<p>Aggie shrugged her shoulders, and then said,
“Pray, what put such an absurd idea into your
head? Tell me all about the picnic,” and she
began to talk rapidly, and to ask me various questions;
but I observed that once she had set me
going—no difficult task—her attention flagged, her
eyes wandered from my face to the fire. She was
not listening to half I said, and my most thrilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
descriptions were utterly lost on this indifferent,
abstracted little creature! I noticed from this
time, that she had become strangely nervous (for
her). She invited herself to the share of half my
bed; she was restless, <i>distrait</i>, and even irritable;
and when I was asked out to spend the day, dispensed
with my company with an alacrity that
was by no means flattering. Formerly, of an
evening she used to herd the children home at
sundown, and tear me away from the delights of
the reading-room at seven o’clock; now she hung
about the library, until almost the last moment,
until it was time to put out the lamps, and kept
the children with her, making transparent pretexts
for their company. Often we did not arrive at
home till half-past eight o’clock. I made no
objections to these late hours, neither did Charlie
Chalmers, who often walked back with us and
remained to dinner. I was amazed to notice that
Aggie seemed delighted to have his company, for
she had always expressed a rooted aversion to
what she called “tame young men,” and here was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
this new acquaintance dining with us, at least
twice a week!</p>

<p>About a month after the picnic we had a spell
of dreadful weather—thunderstorms accompanied
by torrents. One pouring afternoon, Aggie and I
were cowering over the drawing-room fire, whilst
the rain came fizzing down among the logs, and
ran in rivers off the roof, and out of the
spouts. There had been no going out that day,
and we were feeling rather flat and dull, as we sat
in a kind of ghostly twilight, with all outdoor
objects swallowed up in mist, listening to the
violent battering of the rain on the zinc verandah,
and the storm which was growling round the hills.
“Oh, for a visitor!” I exclaimed; “but no one
but a fish, or a lunatic, would be out on such an
evening.”</p>

<p>“No one, indeed,” echoed Aggie, in a melancholy
tone. “We may as well draw the curtains, and
have in the lamp and tea to cheer us up.”</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished speaking, when I
heard the brisk trot of a horse along the road.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
It stopped at the gate, and came rapidly down
our avenue. I heard the wet gravel crunching
under his hoofs, and—yes, a man’s cheery whistle.
My heart jumped, and I half rose from my chair.
It must be Charlie Chalmers braving the elements
to see <i>me!</i>—such, I must confess, was my incredible
vanity! He did not stop at the front
door as usual, but rode straight into the verandah,
which afforded ample room, and shelter for half
a dozen mounted men.</p>

<p>“Aggie,” I said eagerly, “do you hear? It
must be——”</p>

<p>I paused, my tongue silenced, by the awful
pallor of her face, and the expression of her eyes,
as she sat with her little hands clutching the
arms of her chair, and her whole figure bent
forward in an attitude of listening—an attitude
of rigid terror.</p>

<p>“What is it, Aggie?” I said. “Are you
ill?”</p>

<p>As I spoke, the horse’s hoofs made a loud
clattering noise on the stone-paved verandah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
outside, and a man’s voice—a young man’s eager
voice—called, “Lucy.”</p>

<p>Instantly a chair near the writing-table was
pushed back, and some one went quickly to the
window—a French one—and bungled for a moment
with the fastening. I always had a difficulty with
that window <i>myself</i>. Aggie and I were within
the bright circle of the firelight, but the rest
of the room was dim, and outside the streaming
grey sky was spasmodically illuminated by occasional
vivid flashes, that lit up the surrounding
hills as if it were daylight. The trampling of
impatient hoofs, and the rattling of a door-handle,
were the only sounds that were audible for a few
breathless seconds; but during those seconds
Pip, bristling like a porcupine, and trembling
violently in every joint, had sprung off my lap
and crawled abjectly under Aggie’s chair, seemingly
in a transport of fear. The door was opened
audibly, and a cold, icy blast swept in, that
seemed to freeze my very heart, and made me
shiver from head to foot. At this moment there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
came, with a sinister blue glare, the most vivid
flash of lightning I ever saw. It lit up the
whole room, which was empty save for ourselves,
and was instantly followed by a clap of thunder,
that caused my knees to knock together, and that
terrified me and filled me with horror. It evidently
terrified the horse too; there was a violent
plunge, a clattering of hoofs on the stones, a
sudden loud crash of smashing timber, a woman’s
long, loud, piercing shriek, which stopped the
very beating of my heart, and then a frenzied
struggle in the cruel, crumbling, treacherous
shale, the rattle of loose stones, and the hollow
roar of something sliding down the precipice.</p>

<p>I rushed to the door and tore it open, with that
awful despairing cry still ringing in my ears.
The verandah was empty; there was not a soul
to be seen, or a sound to be heard, save the rain
on the roof.</p>

<p>“Aggie,” I screamed, “come here! Some
one has gone over the verandah, and down the
khud! You heard him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Yes,” she said, following me out; “but come
in—come in.”</p>

<p>“I believe it was Charlie Chalmers”—shaking
her violently as I spoke. “He has been killed—killed—killed!
And you stand, and do nothing.
Send people! Let us go ourselves! Bearer!
Ayah! Khidmatgar!” I cried, raising my voice.</p>

<p>“Hush! It was <i>not</i> Charlie Chalmers,” she
said, vainly endeavouring to draw me into the
drawing-room. “Come in—come in.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” pushing her away, and wringing my
hands. “How cruel you are! How inhuman!
There is a path. Let us go at once—at once!”</p>

<p>“You need not trouble yourself, Susan,” she
interrupted; “and you need not cry and tremble;—<i>they</i>
will bring him up. What you heard was
supernatural; it was not real.”</p>

<p>“No—no—no! It was all real. Oh! that
scream is in my ears still.”</p>

<p>“I will convince you,” said Aggie, taking my
hand as she spoke. “Feel all along the verandah.
Are the railings broken?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>I did as she bade me. No, though very wet,
and clammy, the railing was intact!</p>

<p>“Where is the broken place?” she asked,
imperatively.</p>

<p>Where, indeed?</p>

<p>“Now,” she continued, “since you will not
come in, look over, and you will see something
more presently.”</p>

<p>Shivering with fear, and the cold, drifting rain,
I gazed down as she bade me, and there, far
below, I saw lights moving rapidly to and fro,
evidently in search of something. After a little
delay they congregated in one place. There was
a low, buzzing murmur—they had found him—and
presently they commenced to ascend the hill,
with the “hum-hum” of coolies carrying a burden.
Nearer and nearer the lights and sounds came;
up to the very brink of the khud, past the end
of the verandah. Many steps and many torches—faint
blue torches held by invisible hands—invisible
but heavy-footed bearers carried their
burden slowly upstairs, and along the passage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and deposited it with a dump in Aggie’s bedroom!
As we stood clasped in one another’s arms, and
shaking all over, the steps descended, the ghostly
lights passed up the avenue, and gradually disappeared
in the gathering darkness. The repetition
of the tragedy was over for that day.</p>

<p>“Have you heard it before?” I asked with
chattering teeth, as I bolted the drawing-room
window.</p>

<p>“Yes, the evening of the picnic, and twice since.
That is the reason I have always tried to stay
out till late, and to keep you out. I was hoping
and praying you might never hear it. It always
happens just before dark: I am afraid you have
thought me very queer of late. I have told no
end of stories to keep you and the children from
harm. I have——”</p>

<p>“I think you have been very kind,” I interrupted.
“Oh, Aggie, shall you ever get that
crash, and that awful cry out of your head?”</p>

<p>“<i>Never!</i>” hastily lighting the candles as she
spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Is there anything more?” I inquired
tremulously.</p>

<p>“Yes; sometimes at night, the most terrible
weeping and sobbing in my bedroom;” and she
shuddered at the mere recollection.</p>

<p>“Do the servants know?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“The ayah Mumà has heard it, and the khánsámáh
says his mother is sick, and he must go,
and the bearer wants to attend his brother’s
wedding. They will <i>all</i> leave.”</p>

<p>“I suppose most people know too?” I suggested
dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t you remember Mrs. Starkey’s warnings,
and her saying that without the verandah
the house was worth double rent? We understand
that dark speech of hers <i>now</i>, and we have
not come to Cooper’s Hotel yet.”</p>

<p>“No, not <i>yet</i>. I wish we <i>had</i>. I wonder what
Tom will say? He will be here in another fortnight.
Oh, I wish he was here now!”</p>

<p>In spite of our heart-shaking experience, we
managed to eat, and drink, and sleep, yea, to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
tennis—somewhat solemnly, it is true—and go
to the club, where we remained to the very <i>last</i>
moment; needless to mention, that I now entered
into Aggie’s manœuvre <i>con amore</i>. Mrs. Starkey
evidently divined the reason of our loitering in
Kantia, and said in her most truculent manner,
as she squared up to us—</p>

<p>“You keep your children out very late, Mrs.
Shandon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we like to have them with us,” rejoined
Aggie, in a meek apologetic voice.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you go home earlier?”</p>

<p>“Because it is so stupid, and lonely,” was the
mendacious answer.</p>

<p>“Lonely is not the word <i>I</i> should use. I
wonder if you are as wise as your neighbours
now? Come now, Mrs. Shandon.”</p>

<p>“About what?” said Aggie, with ill-feigned
innocence.</p>

<p>“About Briarwood. Haven’t you heard it yet?
The ghastly precipice and horse affair?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose we may as well confess that
we <i>have</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Humph! you are a brave couple to stay on.
The Tombs tried it last year for three weeks.
The Paxtons took it the year before, and then
sub-let it; not that <i>they</i> believed in ghosts—oh,
dear no!” and she laughed ironically.</p>

<p>“And what is the story?” I inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, the story is this. An old retired officer
and his wife, and their pretty niece, lived at Briarwood
a good many years ago. The girl was engaged
to be married to a fine young fellow in the
Guides. The day before the wedding, what you
know of happened, and has happened every monsoon
ever since. The poor girl went out of her
mind, and destroyed herself, and the old colonel
and his wife did not long survive her. The house
is uninhabitable in the monsoon, and there seems
nothing for it but to auction off the furniture, and
pull it down; it will always be the same as long
as it stands. Take <i>my</i> advice, and come into
Cooper’s Hotel. I believe you can have that
small set of rooms at the back. The sitting-room
smokes—but beggars can’t be choosers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“That will only be our very last resource,”
said Aggie, hotly.</p>

<p>“It’s not very grand, I grant you; but any port
in a storm.”</p>

<p>Tom arrived, was doubly welcome, and was
charmed with Briarwood, chaffed us unmercifully,
and derided our fears until <i>he</i> himself had
a similar experience, and heard the phantom
horse plunging in the verandah, and that wild,
unearthly and utterly appalling shriek. No, he
could not laugh <i>that</i> away; and seeing that we
had now a mortal abhorrence of the place, that
the children had to be kept abroad in the damp
till long after dark, that Aggie was a mere hollow-eyed
spectre, and that we had scarcely a servant
left, that—in short, one day, we packed up precipitately
and fled in a body to Cooper’s Hotel.
But we did not basely endeavour to sub-let, nor
advertise Briarwood as “a delightfully situated
pucka built house, containing all the requirements
of a gentleman’s family.” No, no. Tom bore the
loss of the rent, and—a more difficult feat—Aggie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
bore Mrs. Starkey’s insufferable “I told you
so.”</p>

<p>Aggie was at Kantia again last season. She
walked out early one morning to see our former
abode. The chowkidar and parrot are still in
possession, and are likely to remain the sole
tenants on the premises. The parrot suns and
dusts his ancient feathers in the empty verandah,
which re-echoes with his cry of “Lucy, where are
you—pretty Lucy?” The chowkidar inhabits a
secluded go-down at the back, where he passes
most of the day in sleeping, or smoking the
soothing “huka.” The place has a forlorn, uncared-for
appearance now; the flowers are nearly
all gone; the paint has peeled off the doors and
windows; the avenue is grass-grown. Briarwood
appears to have resigned itself to emptiness,
neglect, and decay, although outside the gate
there still hangs a battered board, on which, if
you look very closely, you can decipher the words
“<i>To Let</i>.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had come home from India on three months’
furlough, taking return tickets, and, after the
manner of Anglo-Indians, stayed to the very last
moment of our leave; in fact, if the cab that
conveyed us across Paris, from the Gare-de-l’Ouest
to the Gare-de-Lyons, had broken down—a not
impossible contingency, for our <i>cocher</i> was drunk—we
would have missed not merely our train,
but our steamer, and Charles would have had
to forfeit I don’t know how much pay, and go to
the bottom of his grade.</p>

<p>Charles is in the Civil Service; we are middle-aged
people without any family, and are comfortably
off, and think very little of running home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
We were just in time to get our luggage weighed,
swallow some soup, and climb into the carriage
ere it started. We rattled through France all
night; next afternoon we were at Turin; that
same evening, cramped with two days’ sitting in
the train, and nearly black with dust, we found
ourselves in Genoa. “No time to go to the
hotel,” was the unwelcome intelligence; “we
must go on board at once.” Our steamer lay off
in the harbour, and sailed in two hours.</p>

<p>“Just touch and go,” grumbled Charles;
“never saw such a shave. All your fault,
Louisa.”</p>

<p>Charles was put out. He wanted to have a
tub and his dinner; and, moreover, he hated to be
fussed and driven about by porters, being accustomed
to the grand leisure of an important Indian
official. I never argue with Charles when he is
hungry, therefore I scrambled out of the boat in
silence, and went to my own cabin—secured months
previously. I wondered if any of our friends had
turned up? Colonel and Mrs. Hatton were going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
back in our steamer, Mrs. Clapp, and young
Brownlow of the Secretariat, who had come home
with us. We would be a nice little party, and
all sit at the same table. When I was dressed
I went up on deck; it looked crowded, and I was
immediately accosted by half a dozen Indian
friends, and soon engaged in exchanging items
of news. It was a bright starlight night, and
Genoa looked lovely, rising from her harbour,
but it was unpleasantly chilly. I was afraid of
my neuralgia, and presently beat a retreat downstairs,
and seated myself at a central table with
my gold eye-glasses and blotter, and began to
write a letter. As I sat there alone, listening to
the tramping overhead—the sailors weighing
anchor—I heard a saloon door clap, and some
one came over and took a seat directly opposite
me, with the evident intention of sharing the
saloon inkstand. I am rather near-sighted, and
peered across the table over my spectacles, and
saw a strikingly handsome man, who was deliberately
opening his writing-case. Dark, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
regular features, black hair and moustache, and
slender hands. He looked at me searchingly. His
eyes were the keenest I ever saw; rather narrow,
but piercing as cold steel. We both wrote away
industriously for some time in dread silence, and
then he addressed me with some little civility
about the ink. He had a well-bred voice, and a
slightly foreign accent. We discussed the dust
of the journey, the beauty of the night—for I am
not of the usual order of ancient British matrons,
and when I am spoken to politely, I reply in kind.
This gentleman was more than polite; he was
absolutely fascinating. From Genoa we drifted
to India, but he and I had never been in the
same parts, and, after all, we had not much in
common beyond Bombay.</p>

<p>“You know India well?” he inquired insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“I cannot say that,” I rejoined; “but I have
been in India for many years. I know it superficially,
and from the European standpoint.”</p>

<p>I fished clumsily, and in vain, to discover what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
he was. An officer? no, he was not like one.
A civilian? a traveller? but he parried all my
queries with an ease and politeness that was
actually amusing. How clever he was! I felt
myself a mere child in his hands. In a few
moments, he had extracted from me my husband’s
position, residence, length of service, prospects.
I believe that, if he had chosen to ask, I would
have told him the amount of our ages, income,
and savings. He was so <i>very</i> agreeable, and so
exceptionally interested in me and my affairs, that
I was led away to forget that I was now a stout
elderly woman of forty-five, and, alas! no longer
the station belle I once had been. Presently brisk
voices and steps were heard descending the companion-ladder.
Enter Charles, looking blue with
cold, but in an excellent temper. I saw it in his
eye. He has met Buffer, the Sudder Judge, of
Kuloo, a first-rate whist-player—whist is Charles’s
passion—and they are going to have a split whisky
peg between them, as they discuss assessment of
land—Charles’s hobby. Mrs. Sharpe, an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
neighbour of mine, a plain but clever little
woman, and known as “Becky,” sidled into a
place beside me, and took a good long look at my
opposite neighbour. The tables were filling fast,
and people were calling for lemonade and soda-water,
for it was after nine o’clock. In the lamplight
I recognized a good many familiar faces.
The Brownes of Dodeypore; the Goodwins of
Punea; Major Caraway of the Pioneers (with a
bride). How smart every one looked, especially
the young girls, and young married women! What
a change it makes in some of my friends, a run
home! Where is the old jacket, the joke of the
station? Where is Mrs. Mills’ celebrated black
hat? I would hardly recognize her. She wears
a fringe; she has had something done to her
teeth; she has quite a pretty figure! Who would
believe she was the dowdy creature I saw at
Cheetapore last July? Besides these well-known
faces, are many strange ones—globe-trotters,
Americans, French, and English, going out to stay
with friends, or to do the cold weather in India.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Those who sit at our table are no doubt impressed
by our intimacy and jargon. Mrs. Sharpe always
interlards her conversation with Hindostani, and
speaks of her children at school as my “butchas;”
“and as to going home again for only three
months, as you, Mrs. Paulet” (to me), “persuaded
me into doing, ‘cubbi-nay, cubbi-nay,
cubbi-nay,’”—<i>i.e.</i> “never, never, never again.”</p>

<p>The dark stranger opposite looked amused, and
then she said, “What <i>do</i> you think! I hear there
is a native prince on board, enormously wealthy,
and travelling with part of his Zenana, and all
his jewels!”</p>

<p>The dark stranger still kept his eyes on her,
but the expression of amusement died out of his
face, and he suddenly resumed his writing.</p>

<p>“Who told you so?” I asked.</p>

<p>“My maid,” she answered triumphantly.
“You know I am taking one out; I really
found that I could not exist without a European
servant.”</p>

<p>“You will have to do so, all the same,” I rejoined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
“for if she is at all good-looking, and
under fifty, she is bound to marry a soldier.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dobbs would not look at a soldier!”
retorted her mistress indignantly; “she is <i>much</i>
too grand!”</p>

<p>“Wait till you see,” I replied. “I have had two,
and they were two too many; so particular about
their meals, always complaining of native servants
and of want of society, insisting on going to
sergeants’ balls, and finally wheedling me out
of a wedding breakfast. No, give me an honest
elderly ayah, with no family, and followers.”</p>

<p>“Who wears tight calico trousers, and smokes
a huka,” she sneered.</p>

<p>“And welcome to both, my dear, as long as <i>I</i>
never see them,” I answered, as I rose and said
good night.</p>

<p>The next morning I went on deck before breakfast;
there was a faint fresh breeze, but the sky
and water were both blue, the latter as smooth as
a lake. We were passing quite close to the beautiful
coast of Italy, and meeting various fishing-boats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
and small coasting steamers. As I turned
to search for my deck-chair, I was saluted by the
stranger, as I mentally called him.</p>

<p>And now, in the full broad daylight, instead of
the dim swinging lamps, I saw, with the eye of
an old Qui Hye, that he was undoubtedly a native
of India. Yes, although possibly fairer-skinned
than thousands of the inhabitants of the shores we
were passing, he was an Asiatic, without question;
very handsome also, without doubt, with perfectly
chiselled features, and a broader chest and
shoulders, and a finer physique than one generally
sees.</p>

<p>“A lovely morning; may I bring your chair
under the awning?” he inquired, in a most
deferential manner.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a lovely scene,” I responded, as I
seated myself.</p>

<p>“It is. I am very fond of Italy; are not
you?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I should be, if I knew it well, but
all my travelling has been in India. When my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
husband retires we hope to see something of
Europe.”</p>

<p>“I have what is called ‘done’ Europe—France,
Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain.”</p>

<p>“And to what country do you give the palm?”</p>

<p>“For country, Italy; as a city, Paris. London
is too foggy, too straggling.”</p>

<p>“Then you will enjoy a winter in India.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is three years since I was there.” He
pronounced his <i>w</i>’s as <i>v</i>’s, the only way in which
you could have discovered that he was a foreigner.</p>

<p>“How well you speak English!” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Then you have detected that I am not an
Englishman,” he said, with evident surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Of what country do you think I am a native?”</p>

<p>“Asia—possibly India, or Persia,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Why?—why not a Spaniard, an Italian, a
South American, or a Greek?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you might be a Greek, or an Armenian,
but all the same I think you were born further
East.” I had not been nineteen years in India
for nothing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“You are right,” he admitted with an indulgent
smile. “My mother was a Persian, but I have
been much in Europe. I was partly educated in
England.”</p>

<p>I was scarcely listening to him; my attention
was riveted on a lovely girl, who had just reached
the top of the companion-ladder, and was looking
timidly about. Suddenly she caught sight of my
new acquaintance, and came towards us, with short
hurried steps.</p>

<p>She appeared to be about twenty years of age,
was slight, and of middle height, and wore an
elaborately made white dress and a sailor hat,
underneath which was the prettiest face I had
ever seen. Her complexion was simply marvellous—pure
milk and roses; her eyes, the colour of the
sky, with long black lashes; her hair was really
fair, with flaxen and golden shades through it.
I could not take my eyes off her. As she came
up to my companion, she said with an apologetic
glance—</p>

<p>“You see, I found my way on deck myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Yes, so I see,” he answered, in a not particularly
genial tone.</p>

<p>“The cabin was so stuffy, and I longed for a
breath of the sea air,” she continued, with pleading
eyes.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, suddenly turning to me,
“may I introduce my wife—Mrs. Raymond?”</p>

<p>His wife? I was so taken aback, that for a
second I was speechless with astonishment, and
then I said, as I held out my hand—</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mrs. Raymond? <i>Your</i> first
trip to India, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, with rather a tremor in
her voice; “it is the first time I have ever been
from home.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and I dare say you are a little homesick.”</p>

<p>“It is not so bad as being sea-sick,” remarked
her husband, unsympathetically. “She has never
experienced that yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, once—long ago on the Clyde—I was
awfully sick,” she protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Now that I came to look closely at Mrs. Raymond,
and to hear her speak, I was aware that,
although she was a strikingly beautiful girl, she
was not quite a lady; something in her voice and
her carriage was wanting. She held herself
badly; her hands were large, though adorned by
superb diamond rings. Yes, I, Louisa Paulet,
who rather prided myself on my diamond rings,
had not one that could compare with the least of
those on this girl’s ugly fingers.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will be like this all the
way?” she asked, nervously twisting these fingers.</p>

<p>“I hope so, for my own sake and yours; but
at any rate, let us make the best of the present
moment. There is the breakfast bell at last!”</p>

<p>As cheerful, hungry crowds came flocking to the
different tables (where they had previously placed
their visiting cards), I was rather surprised to see
the Raymonds take seats almost opposite to me.
He had been beforehand with Major and Mrs.
Barker, of the Nizam’s horse, and the Barkers
had to go among the Americans at table number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
two—outcasts from the congenial society of their
Anglo-Indian friends.</p>

<p>I considered Mr. Raymond’s manœuvre was
rather pushing. Surely he might have seen that
we had made up a party, and that he would be
<i>de trop</i>. And all tables were alike to him—so I
thought then. This was the humdrum married
people’s table; number two was American and
French; number three was surrounded by gay
bachelors, grass widows, and brides and bridegrooms.
There was more “go” about it than
the other two put together. Why had not Mr.
Raymond established himself there?</p>

<p>I received his advances with mustard, sugar,
butter, and salt with marked coldness, and in my
most freezing “Burra mem Sahib” manner. But
who could be stiff with a pair of piteous forget-me-not
blue eyes wistfully appealing to them? The
Raymonds were a strikingly handsome couple;
he with his dark resolute face, she with her
wonderful fair beauty. She had already been
noted, for many heads were bent forward, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
glances sent in her direction, and whispered comments
made. They both joined in conversation,
he particularly, and showed himself to be a clever,
agreeable, well-informed man. There was apparently
no topic on which he had not formed an
opinion—from the Irish question, and the new
magazine rifle, down to the last style of dressing
the hair. She did not talk much, and seemed
perplexed at the <i>ménu</i>, especially the “anti-pasto.”
I saw her skin an olive and taste it, and make a
face; she scraped her plate with her knife, and
drank with her spoon in her cup. No, no, no, she
was not a lady. I noticed that she looked behind
her, and up and down the table rather furtively,
and seemed transparently pleased to be one of
such a large and lively community. Possibly she
had never been in such good society in all her
life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weather was perfect, the sea like a millpond,
as we coasted down to Naples. The Raymonds
kept very much to themselves. They would sit
side by side for hours in their two chairs, with
the same rug across their knees, whilst she read
or did fancy-work, and he dozed and smoked.
After dinner they paced the deck arm-in-arm, and
only mixed with their fellow-passengers at meals.
They seemed quite a devoted couple, and when I
remarked this to Becky Sharpe, that lively lady
exclaimed, “Devoted! Where are your dear old
eyes? She is the acknowledged belle on board,
though I can’t see myself what all the men are
raving about. She reminds me exactly of one of
those coloured pictures on a chocolate box—very
pink cheeks, very blue eyes, very yellow hair. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
is as jealous as a Turk. No man dare approach
her. He never leaves her by herself for one
second; they sit half the day under a big umbrella,
and at table are flanked and faced by old
married people. He won’t allow her to join in
any games after dinner, poor girl, and packs her
off to her cabin at eight o’clock. Do you mean
to say you have not noticed this? Why, it is
the talk of the ship!”</p>

<p>I had not noticed it, but I now began to see
that there was something in Mrs. Sharpe’s
remarks, even allowing for her exaggeration. I
never saw a man speak to Mrs. Raymond, I never
saw her husband quit her side, and I observed
that, although he was in the saloon of an
evening, playing whist and other games, she
was not there; and once she said to me at
table—</p>

<p>“Do <i>all</i> the ladies go to their cabins at eight
o’clock, so as to leave the saloon for the gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” I answered. “I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
think of leaving till ten. I like my game of whist,
and we generally have some music.”</p>

<p>That same evening she came up to me and
said, “My husband says I may stay up too, if
you will allow me to sit beside you. Please do,
Mrs. Paulet; it is so dreadfully dull in my cabin.
I cannot go to sleep at eight o’clock, like a little
child.”</p>

<p>“Of course you may sit beside me,” I answered.</p>

<p>I glanced over, and saw Mr. Raymond’s keen,
piercing eyes on me and her. We were all an
elderly party; no one among us was likely to rouse
his jealousy. She, poor girl, seemed delighted
to have so much liberty, and chattered away, as
I had never heard her, to Mrs. Sharpe, and
Charlie, and the Barkers. Every evening she
established herself beside me, work in hand, and
thus it came to pass that I became Mrs. Raymond’s
chaperone!</p>

<p>It was evident that Mr. Raymond was rich; he
had the air of a man who had never had to think
of money. It was whispered that he and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Mexicans and Americans played very high, and
that when he lost he laughed and paid up.
Mrs. Raymond’s dresses were Parisian, more
costly than tasteful. She came out in a set of
Russian sables one cold evening, that made the
other women respect her as they had never
respected her previously, and her diamond bangles,
brooches, and earrings caused even the American
ladies to exclaim. All her belongings were in
keeping, for one day she called me into her
cabin to show me a picture, and I noticed the
luxuries with which she was surrounded. The
silver-mounted looking-glass and brushes, gold-topped
scent-bottles, the cabin and its valuable
contents, including her jewel-case, were all left in
charge of Mr. Raymond’s Mahomedan servant, a
stern-faced, elderly man, with a square-cut beard,
who stood outside the door with folded arms, as
motionless and rigid as a statue. I had had
plenty of Mahomedan servants of my own, and
I must say that I did not take a fancy to Ahmed
Khan. He never salaamed to any one but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
own master, and there seemed to me a sort of
scarcely repressed insolence in his stolid glance.
He was devoted to Mr. Raymond, more like a
dog than a human being; he slept on the mat
outside his cabin by night, and obeyed his merest
glance by day.</p>

<p>“To see Naples and die” is a very fine expression.
I have seen Naples harbour with
dirty brownish waves, seen Vesuvius covered
with snow, the streets covered with mud and
slush, and have very nearly died of cold and sea-sickness
after an awful passage from Messina, in
the very teeth of a gale; but now, <i>en route</i> out,
Naples looked gay and bright—but not a bit more
beautiful in my perhaps prejudiced eyes than
Bombay—and, as the steamer was to wait twenty
hours, we all took boat and went ashore. Charles
and I had been to Pompeii, had seen the cathedral,
so we merely drove about shopping, and along
the Ciaja; and almost everywhere we went we
encountered the Raymonds, with Ahmed Khan in
attendance. She looked radiant. We saw them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
in photographers’ shops, in milliners’, in jewellers’,
and she whispered to me “that he had given her
loads of pretty things, and that she was sending
presents home, and had had her photograph
taken.” I had never seen her in such spirits,
for she was generally rather quiet, not to say
depressed. At the Museum we met them again,
and, as we were poking about among the wonderful
remains from Pompeii, two young men came in,
talking in the loud voices of the British tourists
abroad.</p>

<p>One was a tall nice-looking man, with dark
grey eyes; the other was smaller and plainer, but
had a certain air of distinction about him, and
any one could see at a glance that they were
both officers in the British Army. They went
round together, audibly discussing and admiring
all they saw, and then they evidently caught sight
of us—or, more properly, of Mrs. Raymond, who
was examining a vase with Charles. I was a
good deal surprised to hear one say to the other
in Hindustani—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Did you ever see such a lovely girl? I wish
I was going to stay in Naples.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is just as well you are not,”
rejoined the other, with a laugh; “her father
looks a stern old gentleman.”</p>

<p>Charles to be called an old gentleman, and to
be taken for Mrs. Raymond’s father! The very
idea gave me quite a shock. I glanced hastily
at Mr. Raymond: had he heard too? Apparently
not; if he had, he had an admirable
command over his expression, for he was examining
a quaint mosaic with a smile on his
face. When I turned round the young men had
departed.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk and chilly, and we set
our faces towards the harbour, and after being
nearly upset by rival boatmen, found ourselves
once more safely in the lamp-lit saloon, which
had quite a home look, with its three long
tables covered with flowers, fruit, and Italian
pastry, and duly punctuated by bottles of red
country wine. Six new passengers had arrived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and, to my great consternation, they included
the two young men whom I had seen in
the Museum. Mrs. Sharpe told me that they
were officers in the Prancing Lancers, on their
way to join their regiment at Mhow. The tall
one was Captain Fuller, and the short one was
the Honourable Guy Warneford. They made a
valiant effort to secure seats at our table, on the
strength of a slight acquaintance with Mrs. Sharpe;
but even this did not avail them, for there was
no room, and they were forced to sit elsewhere.
All the same, they attached themselves closely to
our set, and soon had scraped acquaintance with
Mr. Barker, the Borrodailes, and the Raymonds—especially
Mrs. Raymond. They were, however,
not prepared for her husband’s persistent presence.
Was she leaning over the bulwarks, he
was sure to be at her side; sitting, reading, walking,
it was ever the same, and he generally monopolized
the entire conversation. The only time
that Mrs. Raymond was free from his ever-haunting
presence was when she sat beside me, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
dinner, and they made the very most of this!
We landed at Messina, and of course they annexed
themselves to our party. They saw quite plainly
that their company was distasteful to Mr. Raymond,
and redoubled every effort—the combined
efforts, of two audacious young men—to enjoy his
wife’s society, partly because they admired her,
and partly because it made him secretly and
politely furious; it was a capital game! and they
resolved to play it all the way to Bombay. Mrs.
Raymond was no flirt, but she was young, pretty,
and liked admiration; her exquisite blue eyes were
childlike in their innocence—not like Mrs. Swift’s
dark orbs, whose one glance was a whole three-volume
novel! Mrs. Swift was decidedly fast,
and her husband allowed her to do as she pleased.
<i>He</i> was never on duty. This lady was also recently
married, had a plain face, good figure,
pretty feet—which she displayed liberally, and in
six different pairs of shoes a day; she dressed
admirably, was excessively amusing, and self-possessed.
She was generally surrounded by a crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of admiring young men, as she smoked cigarettes,
bringing the smoke out of her ears or down
her nostrils at pleasure. She talked slang, and
behaved herself more like a schoolboy than a
lady. Often have I caught Mr. Raymond’s black
eyes fixed upon her, with anything but a pleasant
expression; and, indeed, I could not wonder that
he did not approve of this remarkably frisky
matron. Ladies, as a rule, did not admire Mrs.
Raymond. She was stupid, and had no style,
and was not a person of good birth; now Mrs.
Swift, with all her fastness, was well born (and
much was forgiven her on this account). Mrs.
Raymond was inclined to boast in a mild way
of her diamonds, and of her husband’s wealth,
of the lovely horses she would drive, and the tribes
of servants she was to have in India.</p>

<p>“My dear good girl!” exclaimed Mrs. Sharpe,
impatiently, “we are all on the same footing out
there. We have <i>all</i> lovely horses, and tribes of
servants; it’s our only compensation! If I had
been you, I’d have made your rich husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
stay at home. Whereabouts are you going to
live?”</p>

<p>“It is not quite settled yet,” she answered
rather grandly. “My husband has a good deal of
property in the Punjaub, I believe. I am not
sure where that is.”</p>

<p>“But what will be your station?”</p>

<p>“I really have never heard him mention
it. I don’t think we have a station.”</p>

<p>“How strange! Well, you will know soon
enough; and if it’s a dull little out-of-the-way
hole, you must make him take you down to Calcutta
in the cold weather, and up to Simla in the
hot season, and to Lucknow for the races. Don’t
let him hide you and make a Purdah Nashin of
you,” she added with a laugh.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> a Purdah Nashin?” inquired Mrs.
Raymond, giggling and displaying her little white
teeth.</p>

<p>“You may well ask! It’s a type you don’t
come across in England. A woman who is kept
secluded from the world in her husband’s house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
who lives and dies there, and never uncovers her
face when out-of-doors, and never sees or speaks
to any man but her husband, or her father, or
her sons.”</p>

<p>“Poor creatures! Are there many of them in
India?” she asked with an air of deep compassion.</p>

<p>“Yes, thousands; they lead an uncommonly dull
life, I fancy, these domestic prisoners. Even when
she drives out, the grand lady has all the carriage
blinds pulled down, just as the common woman
sits behind the drawn curtains of an humble
ekka. When they travel by rail, as they do on a
pilgrimage, there is such a fuss; they are carried
into the station in a dooly, and when they get
into their compartment there is quite a high
screen round them. It is so funny, and most of
them are hideous old hags, as ugly as sin; but I
suppose they like the commotion.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they <i>ever</i> peep? I’m sure I should,”
she said with a merry, girlish laugh.</p>

<p>“If you were young and pretty you would not
get the chance. There is generally some lynx-eyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
old grandmother, who is worse than ten
jailors. As she was kept down in her youth, and
shut away from all the delights of the world, she
now avenges herself on others. She rules the
Zenana with a rod of iron. You have everything
to learn about India, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know nothing about housekeeping and
servants or anything; I should be greatly obliged
to you if you would give me a few hints.”</p>

<p>There was nothing Mrs. Sharpe liked better;
it made her so important. “Get a piece of paper
and a pencil, my dear, and I’ll give you no end
of information; there is nothing like beginning
the right way. Of course,” as the girl sat
down, pencil in hand, “much depends on your
presidency. I suppose it will be Bengal?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” she answered with hesitation.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond had drawn near in a stealthy way
he had, and was leaning against a boat, listening.
They could not see him, but he stood facing me,
and not an expression of his escaped me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Well, you must first secure a good house, with
large and lofty rooms, and a pucka roof; not a
thatched house—be sure of that. Then you will
want a whole retinue of good servants. Your husband
will please himself, but I prefer Hindoos;
Mahomedans are such fanatics and thieves, and
have such an undisguised contempt for our sex.
You will require a good khansamah, and cook
under him, a bearer, two khitmagars, an ayah—an
old woman for choice. Your number of syces
depends on your horses.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Raymond has promised me two lovely
Arabs for my carriage. I have never ridden,
and he says he does not wish me to learn.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, as he is a rich man, you will
have to allow your servants to fleece you to a
certain extent. You won’t get grain, and meat,
and poultry, as cheap as others; but be sure and
settle your accounts with the cook weekly—never
let them run on. Be very particular about <i>this</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“Then about society. You have to call first on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
all the old residents—married people, I mean;
but the bachelors, of course, come and call on
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Raymond’s face was a study.</p>

<p>“The visiting hours are between twelve and
two, the hottest time of the day—and awful in
the plains—but every one goes out in the evening,
riding or driving, and the young men are
playing cricket or polo, so it’s the only time you
find people in.”</p>

<p>“And who returns the young men’s visits?”</p>

<p>“Your husband—or you ask them to dinner;
I dare say they like that better, especially if
the hostess is a pretty woman, and has a good
cook. I hope my little hints will come in
useful. I have no doubt you will have a very
gay time.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” beaming as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a pity you do not ride; but of course
you dance, and there will be lots of balls and
partners for you, and tiffins, and dinners, and
tennis; and you will find that your partners will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
often drop in and look you up in the afternoons.
It civilizes young men to have afternoon tea, and
I suppose your husband won’t mind?”</p>

<p>From the glimpse I obtained of Mr. Raymond’s
countenance, it struck me that there would not
be a warm welcome for his wife’s partners, much
less any invigorating refreshments.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were nearing Port Said, and there was a talk
of getting up a fancy ball in the Canal, the
night the steamer was “tied up;” an energetic
lady—there is always one among the passengers—managed
it, and cleverly evolved costumes out
of almost nothing. There were Indians, Chinese,
Japanese, Britannia’s draped with flags; lazy
people who were merely <i>poudré</i>, and clowns, playing
cards, demons, and witches. The passengers
of a P. and O. (anchored close by) came on
board, and there—with the silent desert stretching
away at either side—was enacted a scene of
revelry, and all went merry as a marriage bell.
Our ship gave the supper, the men the champagne.
Mrs. Raymond was not allowed to dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in costume, or to dance; though it had been
suggested that she should go as “Beauty,” and
her husband as the “Beast,” or as the “Princess
Baldrabadoura,” and her husband as the
“Magician.” I fancy she had had a struggle to
be present at <i>all</i>, for she looked rather pale, and
her eyes were decidedly red, as she came and
sat near me. I was only a spectator, a withered
old wallflower.</p>

<p>“Can you not dance?” I asked, as she steadily
refused partner after partner.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I can, and I am so fond of it, too;
but Mr. Raymond does not think married ladies
ought to dance.”</p>

<p>“I go further,” he said—coming nearer as he
spoke—“I don’t think any ladies ought to dance;
they lower themselves by doing so. They should
leave all this display to nautch-girls; it is only fit
for such! Look at that lady,” pointing to Mrs.
Swift, in a very short dress, “and look at that
one,” indicating another in an exceedingly low body,
“and you call <i>them</i> civilized and refined? I call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
them no better than savages! They are on a par
with a negro woman, who dances round a fetish.”</p>

<p>“You would shut them up, if you had anything
to say to them?” I remarked sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I would—in their graves,” was the startling
reply.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, that there is dancing and
dancing, and I cannot admire these frantic polkas,
or the kitchen lancers.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if you European ladies were not so prejudiced,
you would allow that our Zenana system
was a sound one.”</p>

<p>“No, never; I should never go to that extreme,”
I maintained indignantly.</p>

<p>“But listen to me. Do our women romp about
with other men—half clothed, too!—and shame
their husbands who stand looking on? You saw
those ladies racing round the deck yesterday for
a gold bangle; what sort of an exhibition did you
call it?”</p>

<p>I called it an exhibition of stockings, but I held
my tongue. There <i>was</i> something in what he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Some ladies, I knew, might be eliminated from
society with much advantage to womankind in
general.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> think our women have no liberty,” he
pursued, gesticulating with his thin brown hands.</p>

<p>“I am sure they have not,” I answered emphatically.</p>

<p>“Another mistake! They have far more than in
English families. Although the world does not see
them, our mothers and wives pull all the strings
from behind the purdah. No family matter is
settled without them; be it weddings, purchase of
land or jewels, all those affairs are generally
arranged by them; they are far more deferred to
in money matters than European women, who
are often beaten, and almost always neglected or
ignored where business is in question. An old
lady like you, were she of my people, would have
great authority. And they have ample variety; they
drive about from one Zenana to another, and hear
all the news, and drink coffee with their friends.
Nor are they debarred from male society; they see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
their husbands and brothers and uncles. Once
a woman is married, why should she desire to
see another man than her husband? There
is where the great mistake is made in your
country; were your ladies kept in strict seclusion,
there would be no disgrace, none of those shocking
scandals that become more common every
day.”</p>

<p>“Have <i>you</i> never any?” I demanded in my
tartest tone.</p>

<p>“Rarely, rarely, very rarely.”</p>

<p>“And when one is discovered, what happens?”</p>

<p>“Do not ask me <i>too</i> much,” was his mysterious
reply. “I maintain here to you, an enlightened
English lady, who knows India, and knows the
world, that our Zenana life, our women’s lives, is
infinitely superior to yours. Where women smoke
and drink, and shoot and hunt, and have their
liberty, and make a very bad use of it—ours have
sufficient liberty, but no licence.”</p>

<p>“And yet many cannot read or write, and spend
their days playing childish games, dressing dolls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
quarrelling, or eating sweets; their minds are a
blank.”</p>

<p>“Better so than be full of wickedness.”</p>

<p>“And yet you read French novels yourself; you
have had a good education; you have seen the
world. A woman is to be shut up between four
walls, spending her days like some wound-up
mechanical toy. Is she not as much a human
being as you are?”</p>

<p>“No; she is an inferior,” was his astounding
statement.</p>

<p>“<i>Thank</i> you,” I replied, with an arctic bow.</p>

<p>“But she is well watched and cared for,” he
calmly proceeded, “and is very happy in her
home, and has enormous influence.”</p>

<p>“And yet she may not sit in her husband’s
presence; and when he enters a room, must stand
with her face to the wall!”</p>

<p>“That is seldom done now; these customs are
going out of fashion.”</p>

<p>“Yes, like the bow-string and the sack!” I
retorted, with a spice of temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>At this moment some one came and offered to
take me down to supper, and I was not sorry to
leave Mr. Raymond; there was an odd glitter in
his eyes, and a repressed tone in his speech, that
I did not altogether relish. He had not been
pleased with my thrust about the sack and bow-string,
and for my part I had not fancied being so
plainly informed that I was “an old woman.”
We were never such good friends after that night,
and I think he had an insane idea that <i>I</i>—I,
strait-laced Louisa Paulet—encouraged those two
light-hearted officers in their fluttering round his
wife!</p>

<p>Captain Fuller took me into his confidence one
evening, and said—</p>

<p>“What can have persuaded that lovely girl to
marry that horrible man? Did he pass himself off
as an Italian, or a Greek, or what? Handsome,
I suppose he is, but what an expression! And it
strikes me, that the nearer he approaches his
native shores, the more native he becomes—even in
his dress. He has dropped his smart tweed suit for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
white duck, his deerstalker for a fez, and the fine
new gloss of his European manners has worn
down. He would like to poison <i>me</i>, and I should
be delighted to kick him—to kick him for half
an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, I sincerely hope you will keep the peace;
we have only seven days more. We sight Perim
to-night,” I added consolingly.</p>

<p>“Seven days more! Yes, I wonder what sort
of a life that wretched girl will lead. She is
very simple, and as ignorant in some ways as a
child.”</p>

<p>“She will have carriages and horses, and servants,
and lovely diamonds.”</p>

<p>“And do you think they will make her happy?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know; it satisfies some
women.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not when they are married to a
native of India, with whom they can have but
little in common, and who has an uncivilized
temper. Where is she to live?” he inquired,
with undissembled interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I do not know,” I returned, with a shake of my
head. “She is rather vague about it herself.”</p>

<p>“But surely you can find out? You have been
very kind to her, and I am certain that to feel she
has one friend of her own sex in the country,
would make her happier. Give her your address;
you might drop her a line, and ask how she is
getting on. It would be an act of charity; for, to
tell you the truth, I have my doubts of that fellow.
I would not trust him as far as I could throw him.”</p>

<p>I seemed (I suppose because I am stout and
motherly-looking) to be the general repository of
people’s confidences, for one afternoon, before
dinner, Mrs. Raymond came and took Charles’s
chair—her husband was deep in a game of chess.
He glanced up for a second, but he evidently considered
that she was safe with me, and resumed
his play. I looked at her closely; she had been
crying. This was the second time I had seen her
with red eyes. She moved her chair, so that she
sat with her back to the chess-players, and
said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“I have not had a talk with you for a long time,
Mrs. Paulet.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear; but we can have a good chat
now. You are not looking yourself; have you a
headache?”</p>

<p>“I—I feel the heat; oh, I do hope we are not
going to a very hot place.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” I answered cheerfully.</p>

<p>“And in six more days I shall know! Mrs.
Paulet, I wonder if I shall ever see you again.
Oh, I <i>hope</i> I shall!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some day you will come and pay me
a little visit at Tamashabad?”</p>

<p>“How I should love to stay with you, but——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“My husband would not let me go, I am
sure. Oh, dear Mrs. Paulet, I feel so <i>safe</i>
when I am near you!” and her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>“What does the girl mean?” I asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“I mean”—lowering her voice, two tears now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
rolling slowly down her cheeks—“that my
marriage has been a terrible mistake. I am
afraid of Mr. Raymond, I am—indeed. Oh, why
did I ever leave my home?”</p>

<p>To hear a bride of a few weeks talk in this
way gave me a most unpleasant sensation.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear girl! you are only a little
bilious; it is the sea air. If you had not liked
the man, I’m sure you would not have married
him.”</p>

<p>“It was all my mother’s doing,” she rejoined
in a choked voice. “You see—I need not tell
you—that I am not a lady by birth like you,
and it was a grand match for the likes of me.”</p>

<p>“Tell me where you met him, and how it all
came about? You may be sure I shall keep whatever
you relate to myself.”</p>

<p>“I met him up in the lake country, where my
mother keeps a little inn—The Trout and Fly.
She is a widow and has three daughters; I am
the youngest—and best looking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“I was always a bit spoiled, I suppose on
account of my looks, and I was sent to quite a
genteel boarding-school in Carlisle, where I learnt
French and the piano, and when I came home
I was never asked to help in the housework like
Lizzie and Susan, or to wash dishes or cook;
mother could not bear me to soil a finger, and
so I used to sew and do a little millinery and
that. She never allowed me, even in the busy
time, to set foot in the bar or coffee-room, or to
come across visitors at all; but one day I met
Mr. Raymond on the stairs.” She paused, sighed,
and then added in a most melancholy tone, “And
that began it all!”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” I acquiesced sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Yes, he stayed and stayed, and he hung
about, till he met me and spoke to me. He was
very rich and handsome, and had such beautiful
clothes and rings—so different from any of the
village people. He took a fancy to me, he told
mother, and asked if he might walk out with
me; and of an evening we used to walk together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and he told me lovely stories, and was very
attentive, and gave me a gold watch and chain;
and people talked in a horrid way, but mother
shut them up fine! He was a real grand gentleman,
and he was going to marry me; he and she
had settled it, she said. If I had had to choose,
and he had had the same as young Joe the boatman,
my own cousin, I’d have married young Joe.
However, we were married very quietly, and he
carried me off to London, and bought me splendid
dresses, and took me to the theatres and parks,
and we had a fine hired carriage of our own.
Then we went to Paris, and I liked that; and
oh! he bought me such lovely diamonds. I never
wished for a thing that I did not get it. Just
like in a fairy tale. But though he was very
kind to me, I never could bring him to speak
to me of his relations, his religion, or his home,
and I know no more about them now than I did
then,” she said with a little sob, “and here
we are within four days of Bombay. I have a
presentiment that something is going to happen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and I cannot sleep for thinking of it, my heart
does palpitate so!” As she spoke, her whole
frame quivered.</p>

<p>“Indigestion, my dear! Pray, what could
happen to you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but sometimes Mr. Raymond
is very angry with me, and he frightens me. He
cannot endure me to speak to any one, scarcely
even to <i>you</i>; and he told me that if I ever spoke
to Captain Fuller again he would lock me up
in my cabin. He is quite capable of it. Ah!
what would I not give to be at home? Shall I
ever see our dear hills and lakes again?”</p>

<p>“Of course you will,” I hastily rejoined; “and
meanwhile you will see a very interesting new
country, where I hope you will be very happy.”</p>

<p>“God grant it, Mrs. Paulet!” she returned
gravely. “But sometimes I feel that I shall never
be happy again,” and she gave a little dry sob.</p>

<p>“You should have reflected well before you
married. You are very young; you could hardly
know your own mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Yes; but you see mother is a strong-minded
woman, and manages us all. I never chose a
dress for myself, let alone a sweetheart. And he
was very liberal to mother; he bought her a lease
of the house, and poor mother was just dazzled.
Oh, if I was only back again, sitting over the
fire in the little parlour, with Susan and Lizzie,
I’d never ask to see a diamond, or a horse, or
a silk dress, as long as I lived! Yes, it’s getting
much warmer.”</p>

<p>I looked round to see the meaning of this
irrelevant remark, and discovered Mr. Raymond
close to us, regarding our confidences with a pair
of most suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning he blandly informed us at
breakfast that “Mrs. Raymond was not well, and
was going to remain in her cabin—a touch of
fever, a mere nothing.”</p>

<p>I volunteered to go and see her, to take her
quinine, eau de Cologne, oranges. My offer was
stiffly declined. “His wife had everything she
required; all she needed was repose.” We did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
not see her that day, nor the following one,
nor could we gain access to her cabin by fair
means—or even by foul—for when I surreptitiously
tried the door (having left Mr. Raymond on deck),
I found Ahmed Khan on duty as sentry, and he
assured me with a scowl that “Mem Sahib sota
hye” (Mem Sahib asleep).</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharpe came to me next morning, and
said excitedly, “Louisa, you <i>always</i> say I am finding
mares’ nests, but I am certain there is something
wrong about those Raymonds; we have not
seen her for three days—not since Monday night.”</p>

<p>“No, but that proves nothing. She has not
been looking well latterly—she has fever.”</p>

<p>“The doctor has not been called in. <i>He</i> waits
on her himself; and when he is card-playing, and
on deck, the door is locked.”</p>

<p>“Pray, how do <i>you</i> know?” I demanded judicially.</p>

<p>“I watched and tried it, and then I knocked,
and she said, ‘Come in, please;’ but I saw
Ahmed, and he sent me away. ‘Sahib’s hookum;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
missus sick, could see <i>no</i> Mem Sahib.’ Then I
can tell you something more. Her cabin is next
Miss Lacy’s, and Miss Lacy says she hears dreadful
sobbing and crying. What <i>is</i> to be done?
Shall we speak to the captain?” concluded Mrs.
Sharpe.</p>

<p>“No; a man’s cabin is his castle, and his wife
is his private property. We cannot break in, and
see her against his will.”</p>

<p>“The thing is to communicate with her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I have thought it all out. This evening, when
he is playing cards, I shall slip away, and go into
Miss Lacy’s cabin and knock on the partition,
at the back of Mrs. Raymond’s berth. Don’t <i>you</i>
go; he may suspect you, but he won’t miss <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well?” I said breathlessly, as I entered her
cabin that night, “what success?”</p>

<p>“He was much too clever for me,” she replied.
“I had barely knocked and said, ‘Mrs. Raymond.’
And she said, ‘Oh, who is it?’—‘Mrs. Sharpe,
from Mrs. Paulet. Are you better?’—‘I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
quite well. I never was ill. Hush!’ And I heard
her cabin door opened, and <i>he</i> came in; he
did not talk at first, but I knew he was there.
After a time he said, ‘I have brought your sleeping
draught.’ I had my ear to the berth. ‘Oh,
please, please no,’ she cried; ‘I don’t want it,
and the other made me so heavy for two days.
Oh, anything but the sleeping draught!’ and she
began to sob. ‘<i>Take it!</i>’ you should have heard
his voice; it actually frightened me through the
boards. And then I crept stealthily away, feeling
quite queer and shaky, not to say guilty.”</p>

<p>“We get in to-morrow at nine o’clock,” I said.
“Of course we shall see her then. We will watch
and waylay them. Poor girl! what does he mean
by shutting her up and drugging her?”</p>

<p>The steamer arrived in dock at six—three hours
before her time, and before we were up. What a
bustle there was! After our seven-o’clock Chotah
hazree, packing our small parcels and wraps,
receiving our letters and friends—we <i>are</i> a selfish
world—it was breakfast-time ere I thought of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
poor prisoner. I went to the cabin door and
knocked; no answer. I turned the handle; the
door opened, the cabin was empty!</p>

<p>“How is this?” I said to the stewardess
Theresa, a fat, oily-tongued Italian.</p>

<p>“Oh, the signora was very, very sick, and the
good signor was so attentive, he waited on her
himself (he had given Theresa a handsome tip—that
I could see). He was so anxious about her,
that as soon as we were in dock, he carried her on
deck in his arms, well wrapped up. There was a
doolie waiting with eight bearers. He placed her
in it with his own hands, and she was taken
away.”</p>

<p>On further inquiry, a doolie and eight bearers,
accompanied by a respectable elderly servant, had
been seen going towards the city, and there all
trace of the Raymonds was lost.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Raymond was, of course, a fictitious name. The
unhappy girl, and the mysterious stranger, had
totally disappeared; none of their fellow-passengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
ever heard of them again. They were
both engulfed in that wide and extremely vague
address known as “Up country.” To this day,
Mrs. Sharpe and I, when we meet, shake our
heads together over a certain little mutual intrigue,
and jointly wonder what has become of
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

railway platforms in the North-West Provinces.
A shabby, squalid, weary-looking group, sitting
on their battered baggage, or scrambling in and
out of intermediate compartments; I mean
Jackson, the photographer, and his belongings.
Jackson is not his real name, but it answers the
purpose. There are people who will tell you that
Jackson is a man of good family, that he once
held a commission in a crack cavalry regiment,
and that his brother is Lord-Lieutenant of his
county, and his nieces are seen at Court balls.
Then how comes their kinsman to have fallen to
such low estate—if kinsman he be—this seedy-looking,
unshorn reprobate, with a collarless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
flannel shirt, greasy deerstalker, and broken tennis
shoes? If you look into his face, who runs may
read the answer—Jackson drinks; or his swollen
features, inflamed nose, and watery and uncertain
eye greatly belie him.</p>

<p>Jackson was a <i>mauvais sujet</i> from his youth
upwards, if the truth must be confessed. At
school he was always in trouble and in debt.
At Oxford his scrapes were so prominent that
he had more than one narrow escape of being
sent down. Who would believe, to look at him
<i>now</i>, that he had once been a very pretty boy,
the youngest and best-looking of a handsome
family, and naturally his mother’s darling? Poor
woman! whilst she lived she shielded him from
duns and dons, and from his father’s wrath; she
pawned her diamonds and handed over her pin-money
to pay his bills; she gave him advice—and
he gave her kisses. By the time he had joined
his regiment, this reckless youth had lost his
best friend, but his bad luck—as <i>he</i> termed it—still
clung to him and overwhelmed him. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
father had a serious interview with his colonel,
paid up like a liberal parent, and agreed to his
son’s exchange into a corps in India. “India
may steady him,” thought this sanguine old
gentleman; but, alas! it had anything but the
desired effect. In India the prodigal became
more imprudent than ever. Cards, racing, simpkin,
soon swallowed up his moderate allowance, and
he fell headlong into the hands of the soucars—a
truly fatal fall! Twenty per cent. per month
makes horrible ravages in the income of a
subaltern, and soon he was hopelessly entangled
in debt, and had acquired the disagreeable reputation
of being “a man who never paid for
anything, and always let others in, when it was
a question of rupees.” Then his name was
whispered in connection with some very shady
racing transaction, and finally he was obliged to
leave the service, bankrupt alike in honour and
credit. His father was dead, his brothers unanimously
disowned him, and for twenty years he
fell from one grade to another, as he roamed over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
India from Peshawar to Madras, and Rangoon to
Bombay. He had been in turn planter, then
planter’s clerk, house agent, tonga agent; he had
tried touting for a tailoring firm and manufacturing
hill jams; and here he was at fifty
years of age, with a half-caste wife, a couple of
dusky children, and scarcely an anna in his
pocket. Undoubtedly he had put the coping-stone
on his misfortunes when he took for his bride
the pretty, slatternly daughter of a piano-tuner,
a girl without education, without energy, and
without a penny.</p>

<p>Ten years ago Fernanda Braganza had been
a charming creature (with the fleeting beauty
of her kind), a sylph in form, with superb dark
eyes, fairy-like feet, and a pronounced taste for
pink ribbons, patchouli, and pearl-powder. This
vision of beauty, who had gushed to Jackson with
her soul in her exquisite eyes, and who was not
insensible to the honour of marrying a gentleman,
was she the selfsame individual as this great
fat woman, in carpet slippers, and a bulging tweed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
ulster, who stood with a sallow, hungry-looking
child in either hand? Alas! she was.</p>

<p>The Jacksons had come to try their fortunes
at Panipore—a small up-country station, where
there were two European regiments and half a
battery of Artillery—for is not Tommy Atkins
ever a generous patron to an inexpensive photographer?
The finances of the family were at
a very low ebb that February afternoon, as they
stood on the platform collecting their belongings,
a camera and chemicals, a roll of frowsy bedding,
a few cooking things, a couple of boxes, also a
couple of grimy servants—in India the poorest
have a following, and third-class tickets are cheap.
Jackson had a “three-finger” peg at the bar,
although there was but little in his pocket, besides
a few cards and paper posters, and thus invigorated
proceeded to take steps respecting the
removal of his family.</p>

<p>Poverty forbade their transit in a couple of
ticca gharries, and pride shrank from an ekka;
therefore Jackson left his wife in the waiting-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
whilst he tramped away in the blinding sun and
powdery white dust to see if there was accommodation
at the Dâk Bungalow. It proved to be
crammed, and he had not yet come down to the
Serai, or native halting-place. He was (when
sober) a man of some resource. He made his
way up to the barracks and asked questions, and
heard that the station was in the same condition
as the Dâk Bungalow, quite full. Even Fever
Hall and Cholera Villa were occupied, and the only
shelter he could put his head into was the big
two-storied bungalow in the Paiwene road. It
had been empty for years; it was to be had at
a nominal rent—say two rupees a week—and
there was no fear of any one disturbing him
<i>there</i>! It was large and close to the barracks,
but greatly out of repair. With this useful intelligence,
Mr. Jackson rejoined his impatient
circle, and, with their goods in a hand-cart, they
started off for this house of refuge without
delay.</p>

<p>Past the native bazaar, past the officers’ mess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
past the church, then along a straight wide road,
where the crisp dead leaves crackled underfoot,
a road lined with dusty half-bare trees, whose
branches stood out in strong relief against a hard
blue sky, whilst a vast tract of grain country,
covered with green barley and ripe sugar-cane,
stretched away on the right. On the left were
a pair of great gaunt gate piers, leading by a
grass-grown approach, to the two-storied bungalow—an
imposing-looking house, that was situated
well back from the highway amid a wilderness
of trees, and rank and rotting vegetation. Distance
in this case certainly had lent enchantment to
the view! When the little party arrived under
the wide, dilapidated portico, they found all the
doors closed, the lower windows stuffed with
boards, matting, and even paper in default of
glass; weeds and creepers abounded, and there
was a dangerous fissure in the front wall. After
knocking and calling for about ten minutes, an
ancient chowkidar appeared, looking half asleep.
At first he thought it was merely a party from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the station, wishing, as was their eccentric custom,
“to go over” the haunted house, the Bhootia
Bungalow; but he soon learnt his mistake from
the voluble, shrill-tongued mem-sahib.</p>

<p>This family of shabby Europeans, who had
arrived on foot, with all their belongings in a
“<i>tailer</i>” from the station, had actually come to
stay, to sleep, to <i>live</i> on the premises! Grumbling
to himself, he conducted them up an exceedingly
rickety, not to say dangerous, staircase—for
the lower rooms were dark and damp—to three
or four large and cheerful apartments, opening
on a fine verandah. Mrs. Jackson was accustomed
to pitching her tent in queer places, and
in a very short time she had procured from the
bazaar a table, a few chairs, and a couple of
charpoys, and furnished two rooms—she had but
little to unpack—whilst Kadir Bux, the family
slave, vibrated between cooking and chemicals.
Meanwhile Mr. Jackson, having washed, shaved,
and invested himself in his one linen collar and
black alpaca coat, set forth on a tour of inspection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to stick up posters and distribute cards.
His wife also made her rounds; the upper rooms
were habitable, and the verandah commanded a
fine view; it overlooked the park-like but neglected
compound, intersected with short cut paths,
and which, despite its two grand entrance gates,
was now without hedge or paling, and quite open
to the road, a road down which not a few ladies
and gentlemen in bamboo carts or on ponies were
trotting past for their evening airing. Below the
suite Mr. Jackson had chosen, were the dismal
vault-like rooms, the chowkidar with his charpoy
and huka, and beyond, at the back of the bungalow,
the servants’ quarters and stables, both
roofless. Behind these ruins, stretched an immense
overgrown garden (with ancient, dried-up
fruit trees, faint traces of walks and water-channels,
and a broken fountain and sundial)
now abandoned to cattle. On the whole, Mrs.
Jackson was pleased with her survey. She had
never as yet inhabited such a lordly-looking mansion,
and felt more contented than she had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
for a long time, especially as Jackson was on
his best behaviour—he had no friends in the
place, and scarcely any funds.</p>

<p>In a short time Mr. Jackson had acquired both.
His good address, his gentlemanly voice, and
the whisper of his having once been an officer
who had come to grief—who had been unfortunate—went
far in a military station. With extraordinary
discretion he kept his belongings
entirely out of sight; he also kept sober, and
consequently received a number of orders for
photographs of groups, of bungalows, and of polo
ponies. He had the eye of an artist and really
knew his business, and although some were
startled at the strength of the pegs which he
accepted, he had a large and lucrative connection
in less than no time, and rupees came flowing in
fast. As he and the invaluable Kadir worked
together, he talked glibly to portly field-officers
and smooth-faced subalterns, of men whom <i>he</i> had
known, men whose names at least were familiar
to them—distinguished veterans, smart soldiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and even celebrated personages. He attended
church, and sang lustily out of a little old
Prayer-book, and looked such a picture of devout,
decayed gentility, that the tender-hearted ladies
pitied him and thought him quite romantic, and
hastened to order photographs of all their children,
or, children being lacking, dogs. Little did
they know that Mr. Jackson’s shabby Prayer-book
would have been sold for drink years previously,
only that he found it an absolutely
unmarketable article!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Jackson was convinced that
she was positively about to be “a lady at last.”
She purchased frocks for her sallow girls, a dress
and boots for herself; she set up a rocking-chair
and a cook, and occasionally drove to the bazaar
in a “ticca” gharry, where she looked down with
splendid dignity on the busy bargaining wives of
Tommy Atkins. The chaplain’s lady had called
upon her, also the barrack-sergeant’s wife, who
lived in a small bungalow or quarters beyond the
garden. She had haughtily snubbed this good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
woman at first, but subsequently had thawed
toward her, for several reasons. Jackson, having
been uproariously drunk, and unpleasantly familiar
to an officer, had now fallen back on the sergeants’
mess for his society, and on private soldiers for
his patrons. He was still doing a roaring trade,
especially in cartes-de-visite at six rupees a dozen.
He bragged and talked, and even wept, to his
listeners in the barrack-rooms, and in the canteen:
listeners who thought him an uncommonly
fine fellow, liberal as a lord, flinging his coin
right and left. They little guessed the usual
sequel, or of how the Jackson family were wont
to steal out of a station by rail in the grey dawn
of an Indian morning, leaving many poor natives,
who had supplied their wants in the shape of
bread and meat, coffee, and even clothes, to
bewail their too abrupt departure. Jackson was
“on the drink,” as his wife frankly expressed it,
never home before twelve o’clock at night, and
then had to be helped upstairs, and Mrs. Jackson
found these evenings extremely wearisome. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
rarely read, but she did a little crochet and not a
little scolding; she slept a good deal; and, as
long as her coffee and her curry were well and
punctually served, she was fairly content, for she
was naturally lethargic and indolent. But still
she liked to <i>talk</i>, and here she had no one with
whom to exchange a word. She pined for the
sound of another female tongue, and accordingly
one afternoon she arrayed herself in her new hat
with scarlet cock’s feathers, also her yellow silk
gloves, and with the cook as a body-servant and
to carry her umbrella, she sallied forth to return
the visit of the barrack-sergeant’s wife. She had
not far to go—only through the garden and across
the road. The barrack-sergeant’s wife was knitting
outside in her verandah, for the weather was
“warming up,” when Mrs. Jackson, all-gorgeous
in her best garments, loomed upon her vision.
Now, Mrs. Clark “had no notion of the wives of
drunken photographers giving themselves hairs!
And don’t go for to tell <i>her</i> as ever that Jackson
was a gentleman! A fellow that went reeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
home from the canteen every night!” But she
dissembled her feelings and stood up rather
stiffly, and invited her visitor into her drawing-room,
a small apartment, the walls coloured grey,
furnished with cheap straw chairs, covered in
gaudy cretonne, further embellished by billowy
white curtains, tottering little tables, and a quantity
of photographs in cotton velvet frames—a
room of some pretensions, and Mrs. Clark’s pride.
Its unexpected grandeur was a blow to Mrs.
Jackson, as was also the appearance of two cups
of tea on a tray, accompanied by a plate of four
water-biscuits. It seemed to her that Mrs. Clark
also set up for being quite the lady, although
<i>her</i> husband was not a gentleman. The two
matrons talked volubly, as they sipped their tea,
of bazaar prices, cheating hawkers, and the enormities
of their servants. “My cook,” was continually
in Mrs. Jackson’s mouth. They played a
fine game of brag, in which Mrs. Jackson, despite
her husband who had been an officer, of her
cook, and of her large house, came off second best!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I can’t think,” she said, looking round contemptuously,
“how you can bear to live in these
stuffy quarters. I am sure <i>I</i> couldn’t; it would
kill me in a week. You should see the splendid
rooms we have; they do say it was once a
palace, and built by a nabob.”</p>

<p>“May be so,” coolly rejoined her hostess. “I
know it was a mess-house, and after that an
officers’ chummery, fifteen or twenty years ago;
but no one would live there now, unless they had
<i>no other</i> roof to cover them, and came to a place
like a parcel of beggars!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s up with it?” inquired Mrs.
Jackson, suddenly becoming of a dusky puce, even
through her pearl-powder.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know—and <i>you</i> there this two
months and more?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t; what is there to know?”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you seen him?” demanded Mrs.
Clarke, in a key of intense surprise—“I mean the
Khitmatgar?”</p>

<p>“I declare I don’t know what you are talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
about,” cried the other, peevishly. “What Khitmatgar?”</p>

<p>“What Khitmatgar? Hark at her! Why, a
short, square-shouldered man, in a smart blue coat,
with a regimental badge in his turban. He has
very sticking-out, curling black whiskers, and a
pair of wicked eyes that look as if they could stab
you, though he salaams to the ground whenever
you meet him.”</p>

<p>“I believe I <i>have</i> seen him, now you mention
it,” rejoined Mrs. Jackson; “rather a tidy-looking
servant, with, as you say, a bad expression. But
bless you! <i>we</i> have such crowds of officers’ messengers
coming with chits to my husband, I never
know who they are! I’ve seen him now and then,
of an evening, I’m sure, though I don’t know what
brought him, or whose servant he is.”</p>

<p>“Servant!” echoed the other. “Why, he is a
ghost—the ghost what haunts the bungalow!”</p>

<p>“Ah, now, Mrs. Clark,” said her visitor, patronizingly,
“you don’t tell me you believe such rubbish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Rubbish!” indignantly, “is it? Oh, just
you wait and see. Ask old Mr. Soames, the
pensioner, as has been here this thirty year—ask
any one—and they will all tell you the same
story.”</p>

<p>“Story, indeed!” cried Mrs. Jackson, with a
loud, rude laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a true story, ma’am—but you need
not hear it unless you like it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I should like to hear it very much,”
her naturally robust curiosity coming to the front.
“Please do tell it to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, twenty years ago, more or less, some
young officers lived in that bungalow, and one of
them in a passion killed his Khitmatgar. They
say he never meant to do it, but the fellow was
awfully cheeky, and he threw a bottle at his head
and stretched him dead. It was all hushed up,
but that young officer came to a bad end, and the
house began to get a bad name—people died there
so often; two officers of <i>delirium tremens</i>; one cut
his throat, another fell over the verandah and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
broke his neck—and so it stands empty! No one
stays a week.”</p>

<p>“And why?” demanded the other, boldly. “Lots
of people die in houses; they must die somewhere.”</p>

<p>“But <i>not</i> as they do there!” shrilly interrupted
Mrs. Clark. “The Khitmatgar comes round at
dusk, or at night, just like an ordinary servant,
with pegs or lemonade and so on. Whoever takes
anything from his hand seems to get a sort of
madness on them, and goes and destroys themselves.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine tale, and you tell it very well,” said
Mrs. Jackson, rising and nodding her red cock’s
feathers, and her placid, dark, fat face. “There
does be such in every station; people must talk,
but they won’t frighten <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>And having issued this manifesto, she gave her
hostess a limp shake of the hand and waddled
off.</p>

<p>“She’s jealous of the grand big house, and fine
compound, fit for gentry,” said Mrs. Jackson to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
herself, “and she thinks to get me out of it. Not
that <i>she</i> could get in! for she has to live in
quarters; and she is just a dog in the manger,
and, anyways, it’s a made-up story from first to
last!”</p>

<p>As she reached her abode, and called “<i>Qui hai!
buttie lao!</i>” a figure came out from the passage,
salaamed respectfully, and, by the light of a two-anna
lamp on the staircase, she descried the
strange Khitmatgar, whose appearance was perfectly
familiar to her—a short, square, surly-looking
person. No doubt he was one of Kadir’s many
friends; the lower rooms were generally overrun
with his visitors.</p>

<p>“Send Kadir!” she said imperiously, and went
upstairs, and as she spoke the man salaamed again
and vanished.</p>

<p>The wife of his bosom had a fine tale to tell
Mr. Jackson the next morning, as, with a very
shaky hand, he was touching up some plates in
his own room.</p>

<p>“A Khitmatgar that offers free pegs!” he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
with a shout of laughter. “Too good to
be true. Why, I’d take a whisky and soda from
the devil himself—and glad to get it. My mouth
is like a lime-kiln at this moment—<i>Qui hai!
whisky-pani do!</i>”</p>

<p>Many days, warm and sweltering days, rolled
on; the hot winds blew the crackling leaves before
them, blew great clouds of red dust along the
roads, blew ladies up to the hills, and dispersed
many of Jackson’s patrons. But he did not care;
he had made a good many rupees; he had more
than one boon-companion, and he drank harder
than ever. “Why not?” he demanded; “he had
earned the money, and had the best right to spend
it.” He was earning none now. When customers
came, Kadir always informed them the sahib was
<i>sota</i> (asleep). Yes, sleeping off the effects of the
preceding night. Mrs. Jackson was accustomed
to this state of affairs, and what she called his
“attacks.” She rocked herself, fanned herself
and dozed, and did a little crochet, whilst the two
children played quietly in a back room, with old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
photographs and bits of cardboard. When her
husband did awake, and enjoy a few hours’ lucid
interval, it was only to recall bills and duns, and
flashes of his old life: the cool green park at
home, the hunting-field, reviews at Aldershot, his
pretty cousin Ethel. Then the chill reality forced
itself upon his half-crazy brain. The park was
this great, barren, scorched compound, with the
hot winds roaring across it; the figure in the
verandah was not Ethel in her riding-habit, but
Fernanda in carpet slippers and a greasy old
dressing-gown. Was this life worth living?</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson had seen the Khitmatgar several
times; once she noticed him looking down at her
as she ascended the stairs, once he had appeared
in answer to her call, carrying a tray
and glasses, but she had boldly waved him away,
and said, “Send Kadir; why does he allow
strangers to do his work?” There was something
far too human about the appearance of the
man for her to give a moment’s credence to the
ghost-story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>One still hot night, a night as bright as day,
Mrs. Jackson found the air so oppressive that she
could not sleep. She lay tossing from side to side
on her charpoy, looking out on the moon-flooded
verandah, and listening to the indefatigable brain-fever
bird, when suddenly she heard her husband’s
familiar call, “<i>Qui hai, peg lao!</i>” He had been
drinking as usual, and had fallen into a sodden
sleep in his own room.</p>

<p>After an unusually short interval, steps came
up the stairs, shoes were audibly slipped off, and
there were sounds of the jingling of a glass and
bottle.</p>

<p>The door of Mrs. Jackson’s apartment opened
into the verandah and stood wide, on account of
the intense breathless heat of that Indian night.
In a few moments some one came and paused on
the threshold, tray in hand, some one who surveyed
her with a grin of Satanic satisfaction. It
was the strange Khitmatgar! There was a
triumphant expression in his eyes that made her
blood run cold, and whilst she gazed, transfixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
with horror, he salaamed and was gone. In
a second she had jumped out of bed; she
ran into the verandah. Yes, the long verandah
was empty—he had disappeared. She called
excitedly to her husband; no answer. She rushed
into his room, to unfold her experience. Jackson
was sitting at the table, or rather half lying across
it, his hands clenched, his features convulsed, his
eyes fixed—quite dead.</p>

<p>He had swallowed one of his chemicals, a fatal
poison. Of course, there was the usual ephemeral
excitement occasioned by a tragedy in the station,
the usual inquest and verdict of temporary insanity,
and then a new nameless grave in the corner of the
cantonment cemetery.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jackson’s fate was generally attributed to whisky—or
filthy country liquor. “Poor fellow! his
position preyed on his mind, and he drank himself
to death.”</p>

<p>This was the universal opinion in mess-room,
barrack-room, and bazaar. But there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
one or two people, including his wife and Mrs.
Clark, who thought otherwise, and who gravely
shook their heads and whispered—“<i>The Khitmatgar</i>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> so you two young women are going off
on a three days’ journey, all by yourselves, in a
bullock tonga, to spend Christmas with your
husbands in the jungle?”</p>

<p>The speaker was Mrs. Duff, the wife of our
deputy commissioner, and the two enterprising
young women were Mrs. Goodchild, the wife of
the police officer of the district, and myself, wife
of the forest officer. We were the only ladies in
Karwassa, a little up-country station, more than
a hundred miles from the line of rail. Karwassa
was a pretty place, an oasis of civilization, amid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
leagues and leagues of surrounding forest and
jungle; it boasted a post-office, public gardens
(with tennis courts), a tiny church, a few well-kept
shady roads, and half a dozen thatched
bungalows, surrounded by luxuriant gardens.
In the hot weather all the community were at
home, under the shelter of their own roof-trees
and punkahs, and within reach of ice—for we
actually boasted an ice machine! During these
hot months we had, so to speak, our “season.”
The deputy commissioner, forest officer, police
officer, doctor, and engineer were all “in,” and
our gaieties took the form of tennis at daybreak,
moonlight picnics, whist-parties, little dinners, and
now and then a beat for tiger, on which occasions
we ladies were safely roosted in trustworthy trees.</p>

<p>It is whispered that in small and isolated
stations the fair sex are either mortal enemies
or bosom-friends! I am proud to be in a
position to state that we ladies of Karwassa
came under the latter head. Mrs. Goodchild
and I were especially intimate; we were nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the same age, we were young, we had been
married in the same year and tasted our first
experiences of India together. We lent each other
books, we read each other our home letters,
helped to compose one another’s dirzee-made
costumes, and poured little confidences into one
another’s ears. We had made numerous joint
excursions in the cold season, had been out in the
same camp for a month at a time, and when our
husbands were in a malarious or uncivilized district,
had journeyed on horseback or in a bullock
tonga and joined them at some accessible spot, in
the regions of dâk bungalows and bazaar fowl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duff, stout, elderly, and averse to locomotion,
contented herself with her comfortable
bungalow at Karwassa, her weekly budget of
letters from her numerous olive-branches in
England, and with adventures and thrilling
experiences at secondhand.</p>

<p>“And so you are off to-morrow,” she continued,
addressing herself to Mrs. Goodchild. “I suppose
you know <i>where</i> you are going?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Yes,” returned my companion promptly,
unfolding a piece of foolscap as she spoke; “I
had a letter from Frank this morning, and he
has enclosed a plan copied from the D. P. W.
map. We go straight along the trunk road for
two days, stopping at Korai bungalow the first
night and Kular the second, you see; then we
turn off to the left on the Old Jubbulpore Road
and make a march of twenty-five miles, halting
at a place called Chanda. Frank and Mr. Loyd
will meet us there on Christmas Day.”</p>

<p>“Chanda—Chanda,” repeated Mrs. Duff, with
her hand to her head. “Isn’t there some queer
story about a bungalow near there—that is
unhealthy—or haunted—or something?”</p>

<p>Julia Goodchild and I glanced at one another
significantly. Mrs. Duff had set her face against
our expedition all along; she wanted us to
remain in the station and spend Christmas with
her, instead of going this wild-goose chase into
a part of the district we had never been in
before. She assured us that we would be short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of bullocks, and would probably have to walk miles;
she had harangued us on the subject of fever and
cholera and bad water, had warned us solemnly
against dacoits, and now she was hinting at ghosts.</p>

<p>“Frank says that the travellers’ bungalows
after we leave the main road are not in very
good repair—the road is so little used now that
the new railway line comes within twenty miles;
but he says that the one at Chanda is very
decent, and we will push on there,” returned
Julia, firmly. Julia was nothing if not firm; she
particularly prided herself on never swerving
from any fixed resolution or plan. “We take
my bullock tonga, and Mr. Loyd’s peon Abdul,
who is a treasure, as you know; he can cook,
interpret, forage for provisions, and drive bullocks
if the worst comes to the worst.”</p>

<p>“And what about bullocks for three days’
journey—a hundred miles if it’s a yard?”
inquired Mrs. Duff, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Oh, the bazaar master has sent on a
chuprassie and five natives, and we shall find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
pair every five miles at the usual stages. As to
food, we are taking tea, bread, plenty of tinned
stores, and the plum-pudding. We shall have a
capital outing, I assure you, and I only wish we
could have persuaded you into coming with us.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” said Mrs. Duff, with
a patronizing smile. “I’m too old, and I <i>hope</i>
too sensible to take a trip of a hundred miles in
a bullock tonga, risking fever and dacoits and
dâk bungalows full of bandicoots, just for the
sentimental pleasure of eating a pudding with my
husband. However, you are both young and
hardy and full of spirits, and I wish you a happy
Christmas, a speedy journey and safe return.
Mind you take plenty of quinine—and a revolver;”
and, with this cheerful parting suggestion, she
conducted us into the front verandah and dismissed
us each with a kiss, that was at once a
remonstrance and a valediction.</p>

<p>Behold us the next morning, at sunrise, jogging
off, behind a pair of big white bullocks, in the
highest spirits. In the front seat of the tonga we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
had stowed a well-filled tiffin basket, two Gladstone
bags, our blankets and pillows, a hamper of provisions,
and last, not least, Abdul. Julia and I
and Julia’s dog “Boss” occupied the back seat,
and as we rumbled past Mrs. Duff’s bungalow,
with its still silent compound and closed venetians,
we mutually agreed that she was “a silly
old thing,” that she would have far more enjoyment
of life if she was as enterprising as we were.</p>

<p>Our first day’s journey went off without a hitch.
Fresh and well-behaved cattle punctually awaited
us at every stage. The country we passed
through was picturesque and well wooded; doves,
peacocks, and squirrels enlivened the roads; big
black-faced monkeys peered at us from amid the
crops that they were ravaging within a stone’s
throw of our route. The haunt of a well-known
man-eating tiger was impressively pointed out to
us by our cicerone Abdul—this beast resided in
some dense jungle, that was unpleasantly close
to human traffic. Morning and afternoon wore
away speedily, and at sundown we found ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
in front of the very neat travellers’ bungalow at
Korai. The interior was scrupulously clean, and
contained the usual furniture: two beds, two
tables, four chairs, lamps, baths, a motley collection
of teacups and plates, and last, not least,
the framed rules of the establishment and visitors’
book. The khansamah cooked us an excellent
dinner (for a travellers’ bungalow), and, tired out,
we soon went to bed and slept the sleep of the
just. The second day was the same as the first—highly
successful in every respect.</p>

<p>On the third morning we left the great highway
and turned to the left, on to what was called the
Old Jubbulpore Road, and here our troubles commenced!
Bullocks were bad, lame, small, or unbroken;
one of Mrs. Duff’s dismal prophecies
came to pass, for after enduring bullocks who lay
down, who kicked and ran off the road into their
owners’ houses, or rushed violently down steep
places, we arrived at one stage where there were
no bullocks <i>at all</i>! It was four o’clock, and we
were still sixteen miles from Chanda. After a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
short consultation, Julia and I agreed to walk on
to the next stage or village, leaving Abdul to draw
the neighbourhood for a pair of cattle and then to
overtake us at express speed.</p>

<p>“No one coming much this road now, mem-sahib,”
he explained apologetically; “village
people never keeping tonga bullocks—only plough
bullocks, and plenty bobbery.”</p>

<p>“Bobbery or not, get them,” said Julia with
much decision; “no matter if you pay four times
the usual fare. We shall expect you to overtake
us in half an hour.” And having issued this
edict we walked on, leaving Abdul, a bullock-man,
and two villagers all talking together and yelling
at one another at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>Our road was dry and sandy, and lay through
a perfectly flat country. It was lined here and
there by rows of graceful trees, covered with
wreaths of yellow flowers; now and then it was
bordered by a rude thorn hedge, inside of which
waved a golden field of ripe jawarri; in distant
dips in the landscape we beheld noble topes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
forest trees and a few red-roofed dwellings—the
abodes of the tillers of the soil; but, on the whole,
the country was silent and lonely; the few people
we encountered driving their primitive little carts
stared hard at us in utter stupefaction, as well they
might—two mem sahibs trudging along, with no
escort except a panting white dog. The insolent
crows and lazy blue buffaloes all gazed at us in
undisguised amazement as we wended our way
through this monotonous and melancholy scene.
One milestone was passed and then another, and
yet another, and still no sign of Abdul, much less
the tonga. At length we came in sight of a large
village that stretched in a ragged way at either
side of the road. There were the usual little mud
hovels, shops displaying, say, two bunches of
plantains and a few handfuls of grain, the usual
collection of gaunt red pariah dogs, naked children,
and unearthly-looking cats and poultry.</p>

<p>Julia and I halted afar off under a tree, preferring
to wait for Abdul to chaperon us, ere we ran
the gauntlet of the village streets. Time was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
getting on, the sun was setting; men were returning
from the fields, driving bony bullocks before
them; women were returning from the well, with
water and the last bit of scandal; at last, to our
great relief, we beheld Abdul approaching with
the tonga, and our spirits rose, for we had begun
to ask one another if we were to spend the night
sitting on a stone under a tamarind tree without
the village.</p>

<p>“No bullocks,” was Abdul’s explanation. The
same tired pair had come on most reluctantly,
and in this village of cats and cocks and hens
it was the same story—“no bullocks.” Abdul
brought us this heavy and unexpected intelligence
after a long and animated interview with the head
man of the place.</p>

<p>“What is to be done?” we demanded in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Stop here all night; going on to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Stop where?” we almost screamed.</p>

<p>“Over there,” rejoined Abdul, pointing to a
grove of trees at some little distance. “There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a travellers’ bungalow; Chanda is twelve miles
off.”</p>

<p>A travellers’ bungalow! Sure enough there was
a building of some kind beyond the bamboos, and
we lost no time in getting into the tonga and
having ourselves driven in that direction. As we
passed the village street, many came out and
stared, and one old woman shook her hand in a
warning manner, and called out something in a
shrill cracked voice.</p>

<p>An avenue of feathery bamboos led to our destination,
which proved to be the usual travellers’
rest-house, with white walls, red roof, and roomy
verandah; but when we came closer, we discovered
that the drive was as grass-grown as a
field; jungle grew up to the back of the house,
heavy wooden shutters closed all the windows, and
the door was locked. There was a forlorn, desolate,
dismal appearance about the place; it looked
as if it had not been visited for years. In answer
to our shouts and calls no one appeared; but, as
we were fully resolved to spend the night there, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
had the tonga unloaded and our effects placed in
the verandah, the bullocks untackled and turned
out among the long rank grass. At length an old
man in dirty ragged clothes, and with a villainous
expression of countenance, appeared from some
back cook-house, and seemed anything but pleased
to see us. When Abdul told him of our intention
of occupying the house, he would not hear of it.
“The bungalow was out of repair; it had not
been opened for years; it was full of rats; it was
unhealthy; plenty fever coming. We must go on
to Chanda.”</p>

<p>Naturally we declined his hospitable suggestion.
“Was he the khansamah—caretaker of the place?”
we inquired imperiously.</p>

<p>“Yees,” he admitted with a grunt.</p>

<p>“Drawing government pay, and refusing to open
a government travellers’ bungalow!” screamed
Julia. “Let us have no more of this nonsense;
open the house at once and get it ready for us,
or I shall report you to the commissioner sahib.”</p>

<p>The khansamah gave her an evil look, said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
“Missus please,” shrugged his shoulders and
hobbled away—as we hoped, to get the <i>key</i>; but
after waiting ten minutes we sent Abdul to search
for him, and found that he had departed—his lair
was empty. There was nothing for it but to
break the padlock on the door, which Abdul
effected with a stone, and as soon as the door
moved slowly back on its hinges Julia and I
hurried in. What a dark, damp place! What a
smell of earth, and what numbers of bats; they
flew right in our faces as we stood in the doorway
and tried to make out the interior. Abdul and
the bullock-man quickly removed the shutters
and let in the light, and then we beheld the usual
dâk sitting-room—a table, chairs, and two charpoys
(native beds), and an old pair of candlesticks;
the table and chairs were covered with mould;
cobwebs hung from the ceiling in dreadful festoons,
and the walls were streaked with dreary green
stains. I could not restrain an involuntary
shudder as I looked about me rather blankly.</p>

<p>“I should think this <i>was</i> an unhealthy place!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
I remarked to Julia. “It looks feverish; and
see—the jungle comes right up to the back
verandah; fever plants, castor-oil plants, young
bamboos, all growing up to the very walls.”</p>

<p>“It will do very well for to-night,” she returned.
“Come out and walk down the road whilst Abdul
and the bullock-man clean out the rooms and get
dinner. Abdul is a wonderful man—and we
won’t know the place in an hour’s time; it’s just
the same as any other travellers’ bungalow, only
it has been neglected for years. I shall certainly
report that old wretch! The <i>idea</i> of a dâk
bungalow caretaker refusing admittance and running
away with the key! What is the name of
this place?” she asked, deliberately taking out her
pocket-book; “did you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe it is called Dakor.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well! I shall not forget to tell Frank
about the way we were treated at Dakor bungalow.”</p>

<p>The red, red sun had set at last—gone down,
as it were, abruptly behind the flat horizon; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
air began to feel chilly, and the owl and the
jackal were commencing to make themselves
heard, so we sauntered back to the bungalow,
and found it indeed transformed: swept and
garnished, and clean. The table was neatly laid
for dinner, and one of our own fine hurricane
lamps blazed upon it; our beds had been made
up with our rugs and blankets, one at either end
of the room; hot water and towels were prepared
in a bath-room, and we saw a roaring fire in the
cook-house in the jungle. Dinner, consisting of
a sudden-death fowl, curry, bread, and <i>pâté
de foie gras</i>, was, to our unjaded palates, an
excellent meal. Our spirits rose to normal, the
result of food and light, and we declared to one
another that this old bungalow was a capital find,
and that it was really both comfortable and
cheerful, despite a slight <i>arrière pensée</i> of <i>earth</i> in
the atmosphere!</p>

<p>Before going to bed we explored the next room,
a smaller one than that we occupied, and empty
save for a rickety camp table, which held some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
dilapidated crockery and a press. Need you ask
if we opened this press? The press smelt strongly
of mushrooms, and contained a man’s topee, inch-deep
with mould, a tiffin basket, and the bungalow
visitors’ book. We carried this away with us to
read at leisure, for the visitors’ book in dâk
bungalows occasionally contains some rather
amusing observations. There was nothing funny
in <i>this</i> musty old volume! Merely a statement
of who came, and how long they stayed, and what
they paid, with a few remarks, not by any means
complimentary to the khansamah: “A dirty,
lazy rascal,” said one; “A murderous-looking
ruffian,” said another; “An insolent, drunken
hound,” said a third—the last entry was dated
seven years previously.</p>

<p>“Let us write our names,” said Julia, taking
out her pencil; “‘Mrs. Goodchild and Mrs. Loyd,
December 23rd. Bungalow deserted, and very
dirty khansamah.’ What shall we say?” she
asked, glancing at me interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Why, there he is!” I returned with a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
jump; and there he was sure enough, gazing in
through the window. It was the face of some
malicious animal, more than the face of a man,
that glowered out beneath his filthy red turban.
His eyes glared and rolled as if they would leave
their sockets; his teeth were fangs, like dogs’
teeth, and stood out almost perpendicularly from
his hideous mouth. He surveyed us for a few
seconds in savage silence, and then melted away
into the surrounding darkness as suddenly as he
appeared.</p>

<p>“He reminds me of the Cheshire cat in ‘Alice
in Wonderland,’” said Julia with would-be
facetiousness, but I noticed that she looked rather
pale.</p>

<p>“Let us have the shutters up at once,” I
replied, “and have them well barred and the
doors bolted. That man looked as if he could
cut our throats.”</p>

<p>In a very short time the house was made fast.
Abdul and the bullock-man spread their mats
in the front verandah, and Julia and I retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
for the night. Before going to bed we had a
controversy about the lamp. I wished to keep
it burning all night (I am a coward at heart),
but Julia would not hear of this—impossible for
her to sleep with a light in the room—and in the
end I was compelled to be content with a candle
and matches on a chair beside me. I fell asleep
very soon. I fancy I must have slept long and
soundly, when I was awoke by a bright light
shining in my eyes. So, after the ridiculous fuss
she had made, Julia <i>had</i> lit the candle after all!
This was my first thought, but when I was fully
awake I found I was mistaken, or dreaming. No,
I was not dreaming, for I pinched my arm and
rubbed my eyes. There was a man in the room,
apparently another traveller, who appeared to be
totally unaware of our vicinity, and to have made
himself completely at home. A gun-case, a tiffin
basket, a bundle of pillows and rugs—the usual
Indian traveller’s belongings—lay carelessly scattered
about on the chairs and the floor. I leant
up on my elbow and gazed at the intruder in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
profound amazement. He did not notice me, no
more than if I had no existence; true, my
charpoy was in a corner of the room and rather
in the shade, so was Julia’s. Julia was sound
asleep and (low be it spoken) snoring. The
stranger was writing a letter at the table facing
me. Both candles were drawn up close to him,
and threw a searching light upon his features.
He was young and good-looking, but very, very
pale; possibly he had just recovered from some
long illness. I could not see his eyes, they were
bent upon the paper before him; his hands, I
noticed, were well shaped, white, and very thin.
He wore a signet-ring on the third finger of the
left hand, and was dressed with a care and finish
not often met with in the jungle. He wore some
kind of light Norfolk jacket and a blue bird’s-eye
tie. In front of him stood an open despatch-box,
very shabby and scratched, and I could see that
the upper tray contained a stout roundabout bag,
presumably full of rupees, a thick roll of notes,
and a gold watch. When I had deliberately taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
in every item, the unutterable calmness of this
stranger, thus establishing himself in our room,
came home to me most forcibly, and clearing my
throat I coughed—a clear decided cough of expostulation,
to draw his attention to the enormity
of the situation. It had no effect—he must be
stone-deaf! He went on writing as indefatigably
as ever. What he was writing was evidently a
pleasant theme, possibly a love-letter, for he
smiled as he scribbled. All at once I observed
that the door was ajar. Two faces were peering
in—a strange servant in a yellow turban, with
cruel, greedy eyes, and <i>the khansamah</i>! Their gaze
was riveted on the open despatch-box, the money,
the roll of notes, and the watch. Presently the
traveller’s servant stole up behind his master
noiselessly, and seemed to hold his breath; he
drew a long knife from his sleeve. At this
moment the stranger raised his eyes and looked
at me. Oh, what a sad, strange look! a look of
appeal. The next instant I saw the flash of the
knife—it was buried in his back; he fell forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
over his letter with a crash and a groan, and all
was darkness. I tried to scream, but I could not.
My tongue seemed paralyzed. I covered my head
up in the clothes, and oh, how my heart beat!
thump, thump, thump—surely <i>they</i> must hear it,
and discover me. Half suffocated, at length I
ventured to peer out for a second. All was still,
black darkness. There was nothing to be seen,
but much to be heard—the dragging of a heavy
body, a <i>dead</i> body, across the room; then, after
an appreciable pause, the sounds of digging outside
the bungalow. Finally, the splashing of
water—<i>some one washing the floor</i>. When I awoke
the next morning, or came to myself—for I believe
I had fainted—daylight was demanding admittance
at every crevice in the shutters; night, its dark
hours and its horrors, was past. The torture, the
agony of fear, that had held me captive, had now
released me, and, worn out, I fell fast asleep. It
was actually nine o’clock when I opened my eyes.
Julia was standing over me and shaking me
vigorously, and saying, “Nellie, Nellie, wake; I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
been up and out this two hours; I’ve seen the
head man of the village.”</p>

<p>“Have you?” I assented sleepily.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he says there are no bullocks to be
had until to-morrow; we must pass another
night here.”</p>

<p>“Never!” I almost shrieked. “Never! Oh,
Julia, I’ve had such a night. I’ve seen a
murder!” And straightway I commenced, and
told her of my awful experiences. “That
khansamah murdered him. He is buried just
outside the front step,” I concluded tearfully.
“Sooner than stay here another night I’ll <i>walk</i>
to Chanda.”</p>

<p>“Ghosts! murders! walk to Chanda!” she
echoed scornfully. “Why, you silly girl, did <i>I</i>
not sleep here in this very room, and sleep as
sound as a top? It was all the <i>pâté de foie gras</i>.
You <i>know</i> it never agrees with you.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about <i>pâté de foie gras</i>,” I
answered angrily; “but I know what I saw.
Sooner than sleep another night in this room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
I’d <i>die</i>. I might as well—for such another night
would kill me!”</p>

<p>Bath, breakfast, and Julia brought me round
to a certain extent. I thought better of tearing
off to Chanda alone and on foot, especially as
we heard (per coolie) that our respective husbands
would be with us the next morning—Christmas
Day. We spent the day cooking, exploring the
country, and writing for the English mail. As
night fell, I became more and more nervous,
and less amenable to Julia and Julia’s jokes. I
would sleep in the verandah; either there, or in
the compound. In the bungalow again—<i>never</i>.
An old witch of a native woman, who was
helping Abdul to cook, agreed to place her mat
in the same locality as my mattress, and Julia
Goodchild valiantly occupied the big room within,
alone. In the middle of the night I and my
protector were awoke by the most piercing,
frightful shrieks. We lit a candle and ran into
the bungalow, and found Julia lying on the floor
in a dead faint. She did not come round for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
more than an hour, and when she opened her
eyes she gazed about her with a shudder and
displayed symptoms of going off again, so I
instantly hunted up our flask and administered
some raw brandy, and presently she found her
tongue and attacked the old native woman quite
viciously.</p>

<p>“Tell the truth about this place!” she said
fiercely. “What is it that is here, in this
room?”</p>

<p>“Devils,” was the prompt and laconic reply.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Murder has been done here; tell
the truth.”</p>

<p>“How I knowing?” she whined. “I only poor
native woman.”</p>

<p>“An English sahib was murdered here seven
years ago; stabbed and dragged out, and buried
under the steps.”</p>

<p>“Ah, bah! ah, bah! How I telling? this not
my country,” she wailed most piteously.</p>

<p>“Tell all you know,” persisted Julia. “You
<i>do</i> know! My husband is coming to-day; he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
a police officer. You had better tell <i>me</i> than
him.”</p>

<p>After much whimpering and hand-wringing, we
extracted the following information in jerks and
quavers:—</p>

<p>The bungalow had a bad name, no one ever
entered it, and in spite of the wooden shutters
there were <i>lights</i> in the windows every night up
to twelve o’clock. One day (so the villagers said),
many years ago, a young sahib came to this
bungalow and stayed three days. He was alone.
He was in the Forest Department. The last
evening he sent his horses and servants on to
Chanda, and said he would follow in the morning
after having some shooting, he and his “boy;”
but though his people waited two weeks, he
never appeared—was never seen again. The
khansamah declared that he and his servant had
left in the early morning, but no one met them.
The khansamah became suddenly very rich; said
he had found a treasure; also, he sold a fine gold
watch in Jubbulpore, and took to drink. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
had a bad name, and the bungalow had a bad
name. No one would stay there more than one
night, and no one had stayed there for many
years till <i>we</i> came. The khansamah lived in the
cook-house; he was <i>always</i> drunk. People said
there were devils in the house, and no one
would go near it after sundown. This was all
she knew.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, he was so good-looking!” sighed
Julia when we were alone. “Poor fellow, and he
was murdered and buried here!”</p>

<p>“So I told you,” I replied, “and you would
not believe me, but insisted on staying to see for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had not—oh, I wish I had not! I
shall never, never forget last night as long as I
live.”</p>

<p>“That must have been <i>his</i> topee and tiffin
basket that we saw in the press,” I exclaimed.
“As soon as your husband comes, we will tell
him everything, and set him on the track of the
murderers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>Breakfast on Christmas morning was a very
doleful meal; our nerves were completely
shattered by our recent experiences, and we
could only rouse ourselves up to offer a very
melancholy sort of welcome to our two husbands,
when they cantered briskly into the compound.
In reply to their eager questions as to the cause
of our lugubrious appearance, pale faces, and
general air of mourning, we favoured them with
a vivid description of our two nights in the
bungalow. Of course, they were loudly, rudely
incredulous, and, of course, <i>we</i> were very angry;
vainly we re-stated our case, and displayed the
old topee and tiffin basket; they merely laughed
still more heartily and talked of “nightmare,”
and gave themselves such airs of offensive
superiority, that Julia’s soul flew to arms.</p>

<p>“Look here,” she cried passionately, “<i>I</i>
laughed at Nellie as you laugh at <i>us</i>. We will
go out of this compound, whilst you two dig, or
get people to dig, below the front verandah and
in front of the steps, and if you don’t find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
skeleton of a murdered man, then you may laugh
at us for ever.”</p>

<p>With Julia impulse meant action, and before I
could say three words I was out of the compound,
with my arm wedged under hers; we went and
sat on a little stone bridge within a stone’s
throw of the bungalow, glum and silent enough.
What a Christmas Day! Half an hour’s delay
was as much as Julia’s patience could brook.
We then retraced our steps and discovered what
seemed to be the whole village in the dâk
bungalow compound. Frank came hurrying
towards us, waving us frantically away. No
need for questions; his face was enough. They
had found it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Frank Goodchild had known him—he was in
his own department, a promising and most
popular young fellow; his name was Gordon
Forbes; he had been missed but never traced,
and there was a report that he had been gored
and killed in the jungle by a wild buffalo. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the same grave was found the battered despatch-box,
by which the skeleton was identified. Mr.
Goodchild and my husband re-interred the body
under a tree, and read the Burial Service over
it, Nellie and I and all the village patriarchs
attending as mourners. The khansamah was
eagerly searched for—alas! in vain. He disappeared
from that part of the country, and was
said to have been devoured by a tiger in the
Jhanas jungles; but this is too good to be true.
We left the hateful bungalow with all speed that
same afternoon, and spent the remainder of the
Christmas Day at Chanda; it was the least
merry Christmas we ever remembered. The
Goodchilds and ourselves have subscribed and
placed a granite cross, with his name and the
date of his death, over Gordon Forbes’s lonely
grave, and the news of the discovery of the
skeleton was duly forwarded to the proper
authorities, and also to the unfortunate young
man’s relations, and to these were sent the
despatch-box, letters, and ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Mrs. Duff was full of curiosity concerning our
trip. We informed her that we spent Christmas
at Chanda, as we had originally intended, with
our husbands, that they had provided an excellent
dinner of black buck and jungle fowl, that the
plum-pudding surpassed all expectations; but
we never told her a word about our two nights’
halt at Dakor bungalow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom Galway</span> (of the Princess’s Own Pea Green
Pioneers) had evidently some weighty matter on
his mind, as he lounged in a long chair in his
verandah, nursing a veteran fox-terrier, and
puffing furiously at a “Trichy” cheroot. Perhaps
Tom was endeavouring to accustom himself
to his new honours? His step was in that day’s
<i>Gazette</i>, and for the last four hours he had been
entitled to write “captain” at either end of his
signature. He was a broad-shouldered, well set-up
young man of eight-and-twenty, with sleepy-looking
grey eyes, closely-cropped black hair, and
a luxuriant moustache; his countenance was
more remarkable for placid contentment than for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
brilliant intelligence. To tell the honest truth,
Tom was not particularly sharp; he had only
scraped through his examinations and mastered
the drill-book by what he called “the skin of
his teeth,” and with extraordinary (and to him)
exhaustive mental exertions. His best friend
never thought Tom Galway clever, but he was
sporting, good-natured, and good-tempered. He
never made a joke at any one’s expense—possibly
because he could not—and he never said an ill
word of mortal; he was slow, his thoughts moved
languidly and took some time to grasp a subject;
his blunders, literary and social, were the delight
of the mess; but he was a reliable officer, a keen
sportsman, and “Old Tom” was one of the most
popular fellows in the “Princess’s Own Pioneers.”
Tom was in the unfortunate condition common
to a few other subalterns—Tom was impecunious;
he did not gamble, bet, or drink; he kept
no stud beyond a gaunt old caster, who enjoyed
the appropriate name of “Barebones;” his clothes
were latterly—tell it not in Gath—manufactured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
in his own verandah. Where the money went
to was one of the desperate problems that frequently
puzzled poor Tom; not that there was
so <i>much</i> to go—two hundred and fifty rupees a
month. Innocent British reader, if you like to
do a nice little mental sum, a rupee is one
shilling and threepence. Alas! alas! for the good
old days, when the beloved coin was worth two
shillings; woe, woe to those who have to remit
money home. Luckily, Tom Galway was spared
<i>this</i> harrowing experience. Of what was Tom
thinking so earnestly? Of the burning currency
question? Of his debts? Of his new responsibilities?
Whatever his thoughts were, they suddenly
culminated in action, for he cast away his
cheroot, flung down the dog, went into the interior
of his bungalow, dragged out a well-preserved
leather writing-case and sat himself down before
it. At this moment another young man, riding
a lean chestnut pony, and dressed in cricket
flannels and a gaudy striped coat, galloped up
under the porch, as if he was being hotly pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
by a pack of wolves. Throwing the reins to a
panting syce, he shouted—</p>

<p>“Hullo, Tom, so there you are! I’ve just
come from the mess. I’ve told them to put the
champagne in ice for to-night.”</p>

<p>“For what?” asked Tom, with a vacant look.</p>

<p>“Why, man alive, you’ve got to stand it!
What are you mooning about? Did you not get
your company to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh! of course; of course, to be sure,”
assented Tom, eagerly.</p>

<p>“What are you about; aren’t you coming down
to rackets?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s mail day,” protested Tom rather
sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Bosh! Why, you know you never write a
letter, you old humbug.”</p>

<p>“Well, any way, I’m going to write one <i>now</i>,
so clear.”</p>

<p>“To our mutual tailor? Give him my kind
regards, and tell him that he will be paid in the
coming by-and-by, and meanwhile to send you a
couple of new suits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“I don’t owe him a penny,” said Tom, biting
the end of his pen. “I’ve cleared <i>him</i> off, thank
goodness.”</p>

<p>“Wish I could say the same,” said his comrade,
hitching himself up on the corner of the table.
“Maybe you are thinking of <i>another</i> kind of
suit? I see my brilliant wit is thrown away
on you! but you’ve heard of a law suit, eh,
and of a love suit? He’s blushing, I declare—he
can’t look me in the face. By Jove, he’s in love!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jack,” said Tom, who certainly
had become a shade redder, “can you stop your
tomfoolery for once, and listen to me rationally
for five minutes? I’m—ahem—I’m—thinking—of—getting
married!”</p>

<p>At this announcement, Jack bounded off the
table, rushed to the door, and placing both hands
to his mouth, gave a wild view halloa that made
the neighbouring compounds ring, and threw
“Topper,” the terrier, into a paroxysm of excitement.</p>

<p>Having thus relieved his feelings, he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
quite gravely to his friend, drew up a chair,
and leaning both elbows on the table, said—</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it, old chappie, but break
it to me very gently, if it’s one of our Blazapore
spins.”</p>

<p>“No, no; no fear—she is at home.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your new-made honours have put
<span class="allsmcap">THIS</span> into your head?” said Jack, surveying his
chum with gaping half-contemptuous amazement.</p>

<p>“No—it has been in my head this long time;
but, you see, I could not afford to marry.”</p>

<p>“Has <i>she</i> no coin?”</p>

<p>“Not a penny.”</p>

<p>“Come! that’s bad—and mind you, a captain’s
pay is not a mine of wealth.”</p>

<p>“She is not extravagant—neither am I—we
shall do as well as our neighbours.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said the other, dubiously; “but
who <i>is</i> she?”</p>

<p>“First of all, promise that you won’t go
tearing round the station telling every one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Am I a cackling old woman!” demanded Jack,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, you remember when we were quartered at
Baymouth—you recollect the two Miss Brownes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure I do—aunt and niece; aunt,
rather ancient, voice like a peacock, smart frocks,
pots of money; niece, pretty, and of course,
penniless.”</p>

<p>“It’s the niece,” said Tom, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“So I should <i>hope</i>. I am glad to find that I
have cultivated your taste to some purpose. I
wish she had a few thousands and I would give
you my consent, and maybe, a wedding present.”</p>

<p>“Your consent is not going to be asked for.”</p>

<p>“And how long has this been going on, you
sly dog? Are you engaged to her?”</p>

<p>“No such luck. I could not well invite her
to share a subaltern’s pay. She is not married
yet, I know, and I’m going to write to her this
mail, and ask her to be——”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Galway! Hooroo, hooray! And owner
of Bungalow No. 25, two cane chairs, one camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
table, one fox-terrier dog, aged, ditto bay horse,
deaf and blind——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, will you, you young idiot?” said his
friend, impatiently. “I know that her aunt leads
her a devil of a life, and to come out to a home
of her own would be a merciful release. You
see she is companion, ladies’ maid, gooseberry,
and scapegoat. Poor girl, she has had hard
lines.”</p>

<p>“I remember Miss Browne, Senior—she was
at every ball and tennis-party in the place,”
observed Jack Murray, thoughtfully. “The niece
was always kept well in the background. I was
rather interested in the niece <i>myself</i>, but her
aunt declared she hated society and had other
engagements.”</p>

<p>“Her other engagements were sitting at home,
darning stockings or crying her eyes out,” said
Captain Galway. “Her aunt is a Tartar, if ever
there was one. A soured, ill-natured, hypocritical
old cat.”</p>

<p>“All the same she is a well-gilt old cat. Has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
heaps of coin. I wonder if she will give her niece
a dowry?”</p>

<p>“If she gives her her passage money I shall be
agreeably surprised,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I suppose you want to write <i>the</i>
letter, and I won’t disturb you,” said Jack Murray,
rising, “unless I can be of any assistance? Eh?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you”—very gruffly.</p>

<p>“Mind you say what you <i>mean</i>, and don’t make
a mull of the whole concern. ’Pon my word, I
think you had better let me draft you a copy.”</p>

<p>For an answer his comrade took up a volume of
the Queen’s Regulations and shied it at Jack, who,
ducking his head, just evaded the missile, and,
with another ear-splitting screech, mounted his
barrack tat, and gleefully decamped.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jack was a merry subaltern, whose gaiety never
knew a cloud, whose face was never overcast, and
who found existence intensely amusing, thoroughly
enjoyed life, and the pleasures, excitements, duties,
and diversions that it brought him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>It was no easy matter to Tom Galway to indite
any letter—much less a love-letter. (His departed
friend could have knocked off a <i>billet-doux</i> in less
than five minutes.) How he bit the end of his
pen, how he tore up sheet after sheet of the best
crested regimental notepaper, how he wished he
had taken Jack Murray’s offer, I will not linger
to relate. In the end, he contrived to concoct
and finish a missive, and was so completely exhausted
and done up, that he was obliged to
relieve his flagging faculties with a stiff whisky
and soda.</p>

<p>“A letter like that takes it out of a fellow frightfully!”
muttered Tom, mopping his forehead.
“However, it’s done, and off my mind.”</p>

<p>He was a person of slow mental evolution; he
had been deliberating over this step for months,
and he had taken it at last. He dressed, carried
the letter over to the mess, saw it placed in the
post-bag and started on the first stage of its long
journey. He stood and looked after the letter-corporal
with an unusually solemn face. Would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
he recall the epistle if he could? No, no; ten
thousand times, no. Nevertheless, between the
important invitation just despatched and the responsibility
of being actually captain of F company,
our hero was considerably sobered, and that night
at mess his silence and abstraction, despite several
beakers of his own champagne, was the subject of
unlimited remark and chaff. He did not fire up at
the news of a polo scurry, nor join a tug-of-war
with one of the punkah ropes, nor even jump at
the proposal to put a buffalo calf into Major Pratt’s
bed! [N.B.—Major Pratt was dining elsewhere.
He was a little, lean, hungry-looking man, with a
sharp nose and red moustache, adored by his
regiment, and the idol of the fair sex—according
to his own account. A less partial view was taken
by the world, but is not that generally the case?
Men who had a good opportunity of knowing the
major, said that he was as deep as a draw-well;
that he shirked his work; that he funked riding,
and that he was a regular little screw! The fair
sex said—but no matter! it is enough for me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
chronicle that they did not accept him at his own
valuation.]</p>

<p>Weeks rolled by, and then one happy, happy
day the post-office peon, with his tri-coloured
turban, brought Captain Galway a telegram, that
had come all the way from England! It was brief,
to the point, and most satisfactory, and said—</p>

<p>“Yes—letter follows.—L. Browne.”</p>

<p>Tom showed this precious document to Jack
Murray with undisguised triumph, for Jack had
been dubious of the answer, and when his chum
had talked, in foolishly sanguine moments, of
“doing up the garden” and “buying a piano,
which was going a dead bargain,” Jack had thrown
cold water on these designs, and said, “I would
not be so dead sure, that she will come, my
Thomas! It strikes me that you are counting
your chickens before they are hatched.”</p>

<p>Tom never argued the point, but frequently
refreshed his hopes by contemplating a certain
photograph and a withered bunch of forget-me-nots,
that lay hidden in the recesses of his battered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
old desk, and said to himself, “She will come right
enough.”</p>

<p>Undeniably men are vain creatures.</p>

<p>After this auspicious telegram, Jack was silenced.
His friend was magnanimous, and did not say, “I
told you so,” but he laboured diligently in the
garden, he bought the piano, he took his colonel’s
wife into his confidence, and he talked so incessantly
of “her”—of “Lily”—that Jack was
seriously thinking of dissolving partnership and
moving into another bungalow. Of course, when
it was noised abroad that Tom Galway—Tom
Galway! who did not know “God save the Queen”
from the “Dead March” in <i>Saul</i>—had purchased
a piano, and that the instrument was actually on
view, in his barn-like abode, there was no need for
Tom to make any further announcement to his
brother officers or the station. It was plain that
Tom was going to be married! Naturally he was
the legitimate object of any amount of chaff, which
chaff he bore with his usual phlegmatic good
humour and a broad grin of ridiculous complacency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>He had now received two precious letters from
Lily; she announced that she was making arrangements
for coming out with some friends immediately,
as it was a good opportunity that might
not occur again. She had taken her passage in
the P. and O. <i>Chusan</i>, and would be in Bombay
early in November.</p>

<p>A portion of this was imparted to Jack, but bits
were skipped here and there, in a highly suspicious
manner.</p>

<p>“I suppose she says nothing of the <i>aunt</i>?”
inquired Mr. Murray, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Not a word. The letters are short”</p>

<p>“Short and <i>sweet</i>, eh? Well, the only drawback
that <i>I</i> see is old Miss Browne! She will be
worse than a mother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Not with the seas between us,” retorted Tom
emphatically.</p>

<p>“She might come <i>out</i>,” suggested Jack. “By
Jove! do you know that I used to think she was
rather sweet on you <i>herself</i>, eh?”</p>

<p>“Bosh,” said Tom, reddening. The same idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
had once occurred to his slower intelligence, only
to be angrily repudiated. “She might be my
mother, you young donkey.” All the same, he
had vivid recollections of when he would fain have
sauntered round the gardens with Lily—it was the
aunt, who had held him in agreeable dalliance; it
was <i>she</i> who picked flowers and placed them in his
button-hole with her own white fingers and a
girlish simper; it was she who asked for his photograph,
who kept him a prisoner in close <i>tête-à-tête</i>
at tennis-parties and dances, whilst his whole mind
was on the rack to know what had become of Lily.
At first he had thought Miss Browne a harmless,
vain, loquacious old maid; but subsequently he
overheard sharp, bitter speeches to her niece; he
had seen Lily’s tears, her constant humiliations;
had contrasted her dowdy old dresses with her
aunt’s brilliant toilettes, and had come to the conclusion
that Miss Browne was a selfish, scheming
vixen, and that he could not endure the sight of
her. As time went on, Bungalow 25 became quite
transformed, thanks to Mrs. Cornwall, the wife of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
the colonel of the regiment, who gave not only
sympathy and useful hints, but practical assistance:
pretty furniture was picked up and covered
with new cretonne, curtains were hung in doorways,
new matting was laid down, pictures were disposed
on the walls, a pony cart, side saddle, cook and
ayah, were figuratively laid in. Miss Browne was
to be received by Mrs. Cornwall, and married from
her house; in the monotonous cantonment life
at Blazapore, the arrival of Captain Galway’s
pretty young bride was awaited with extraordinary
interest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Browne, Senior (Christian name, Lavinia),
had been a beauty in her day, and still possessed
some remains of her former good looks; she was
now upwards of forty, but, with a youthful figure,
well-cut gowns, and smart little bonnets, might
be taken for five-and-thirty—especially in a veil,
or with her back to the light. Many people
wondered that she was not married, and no one
was more astonished at this omission than Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Browne herself. Of course, she had refused
scores of offers—fifty-nine altogether—and had
had two heart-breaking disappointments. This
she imparted to her friends, naturally in the
strictest confidence. She also informed them
that nothing would induce her to marry now;
her affections were in the grave, and all she had
to live for was her niece—a strange, eccentric,
impassive girl, who detested society. Now, Miss
Browne herself was ordered “cheerful surroundings”
by her medical man, and to be a great deal
in the open air, with lively, pleasant associates,
and to take moderately active exercise; as, for
instance, tennis-playing and dancing, and to
indulge in change of scene, and the best and
soundest Burgundy. She was rather partial to
the military, and made no secret of her taste.
Her solid-looking, comfortable detached house
was always open to the officers (unmarried) of the
garrison; not merely for miserable little afternoon
teas, but good substantial luncheons and well-cooked
dinners. At these Miss Browne presided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
in ravishing toilettes, and with the airs of a belle
of twenty. She was generally supported by one
or two mature matrons, but her niece was never
present—to tell the honest truth, she was
marshalling the dishes in the back hall, or
occupied in the kitchen.</p>

<p>One autumn morning Miss Browne came down
to breakfast, unlocked the post-bag, and took out
the letters. She was not in a genial humour.
It was a raw kind of day, and her dressmaker’s
bill had been a disagreeable surprise. What was
this thin epistle, an Indian letter?</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Miss Browne, The Grove.</i>”</p>

<p>Her face became rather red; then she tore it
open, and after glancing at the signature, proceeded
to devour it. It ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Browne</span>,</p>

<p>“I wish I might put <i>my</i> dear Miss
Browne, but I hope the answer to this letter will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
give me that delightful privilege” (Tom had thought
this a very neat and effective opening). “I have
not seen you for nearly two years, but I have
heard of you through the Covingtons, and that
you are <i>still unmarried</i>. Absence has made the
heart grow fonder in my case. I trust it has been
the same in yours—at least, that you have not
forgotten <i>me</i>, and those jolly days we spent
together the year before last. I have just got
my company, and I write the same day to ask
you to be my wife. I can now offer you a
comfortable home, and I am sure you would like
India. If you could come out this cold weather,
and marry me in Bombay, I should esteem it an
honour.”</p>
</div>

<p>This sentence seemed somewhat cold and
commonplace to Tom, so he added—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Darling Miss Browne, you knew that I adored
you, but dared not speak sooner; if you love
me, come out as soon as ever you can, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
make Blazapore a paradise—For yours most
faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Tom Galway</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.—I have the forget-me-nots still.”</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Browne perused this effusion with a very
high colour, and equally mingled portions of
emotion, astonishment, and rapture! Now and
then she paused to re-read a sentence, as if she
could not believe her <i>eyes</i>. An offer of marriage!
To go to India to be Mrs. Tom Galway! Her
brain was in a whirl. What an unexpected
summons! What would the Robinsons say, and
the Fishers, and the Smiths? What bliss! what
triumph! Visions of a superb trousseau, of India,
elephants, palm trees, wedding-cake, and a sea
voyage, all flashed through her mind. Suddenly
she looked over at her pretty, pale niece, who was
pouring out the coffee, and said rather sharply—</p>

<p>“Lily?”</p>

<p>“Yes, aunt?” lifting a pair of lovely brown
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“You remember an officer who was here the
summer before last; he was in the Pioneers, and
paid me a great deal of attention—Tom Galway?”</p>

<p>Lily nodded; she had now become extremely red.</p>

<p>“I have just had a letter from him.”</p>

<p>“A letter!” she echoed in a faint voice.</p>

<p>“Yes—containing an offer of marriage.”</p>

<p>“For——” began the girl, and then she
stopped.</p>

<p>“For <i>me</i>, of course,” said her aunt, suddenly
standing up and dusting the crumbs off her apron.
“Who else do you suppose?”</p>

<p>Poor Lily! the colour sank quickly from her
cheeks, she was now as white as the table-cloth.
Miserable girl! her little love idyl had been brief,
uncertain, and uncomfortable—guiltily snatched
moments of conversation—secret gifts of flowers—stealthy
promises—incoherent farewells. She
liked Tom Galway, good-looking, good-tempered,
stupid Tom—her one hope had been that he would
return and claim her when he got his company.
He had not said so—in so many words—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
somehow it was understood, and when they parted
she had given him a little bunch of forget-me-nots,
and he—he had kissed her hand! but then, of
course, Tom was notoriously stupid. He had
certainly paid court to her aunt; he had been
obliged to walk and talk with her, to gain a footing
in the Grove at <i>all</i>, and in this Tom displayed
unusual craft. Now all the time he had been in
earnest, as regarded Aunt Lavinia!—for she was
rich and he was poor—and he had only been
amusing himself with <i>her</i>. Oh, faithless—faithless—mercenary
Tom!</p>

<p>“Well, have you <i>nothing</i> to say?” demanded
Miss Browne rather shrilly. “How different
you are to other girls! Why don’t you come
round and kiss me, and congratulate me, eh?”</p>

<p>Lily rose—certainly Lily was a stoic—and came
and laid a marble cheek against her aunt’s highly
artistic skin.</p>

<p>“I—I—I—hope you will be happy, Aunt
Lavinia,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“I’m <i>sure</i> I shall. Captain Galway is good-tempered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
handsome, and passionately attached
to me. You may make your mind quite easy
about my future. Why do you look so white
and odd? Is there one drawback? Come—speak
out!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you—don’t you—think he is rather—rather——”</p>

<p>“What?” she snapped explosively.</p>

<p>“Rather—young?”</p>

<p>“Young! Why he is past thirty, nearly my
own age.” (Oh, come! Miss Browne.) “Young!
Rubbish. The Queen was older than Prince
Albert. Well, I can’t stay here talking all day.
I must send off a telegram. I must run across
and tell the Smiths and Joneses, and call in at
Miss Tuck’s about the trousseau. You might go
round and look up that woman who comes out
sewing by the day. By-the-by, what’s to be done
with <i>you</i>? Tom never thought of that—foolish
fellow! he is so taken up with <i>me</i>. I’ll send you
to board in some respectable quiet family—or
a finishing school—or somewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Then Miss Browne, Senior, set about her preparations
with inconceivable promptitude, and despatched
the telegram and letters which threw
Tom Galway into such a transport of happiness.</p>

<p>The <i>Chusan</i> arrived in Bombay two days before
her time, and “Miss Browne” was among the
passengers; her toilettes were Parisian, and her
airs and assumption of youth were more ridiculous
than ever. She displayed Tom’s photograph in
dead secrecy to about fifteen different ladies, who
marvelled at this handsome young man’s infatuation,
and subsequently nodded, and giggled among
themselves and said, “<i>Money</i>.”</p>

<p>The yearly inspection was in full swing at
Blazapore, so Tom had not the smallest chance
of getting leave to meet his <i>fiancée</i> at Bombay.
She was expected to arrive in three days’ time,
and all preparations for her reception were nearly
completed. Tom had had a long spell at musketry
on the ranges, and was resting himself in his
own verandah when Jack Murray arrived at a
gallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“I say, Tom! Look alive!” he began breathlessly.
“She’s come!”</p>

<p>“Who? Who has come?” said Tom, jumping
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Why, she—Lily—Miss Browne. She drove
up to the Cornwalls’ just now—a strange lady,
pretty figure, thick white gauze veil. So hurry up!
Hurry up!”</p>

<p>No need to repeat this injunction; Tom was
already in his own apartment, tearing off his
dusty uniform, and shouting to his chokra for
his boots, his best suit, and a clean shirt. It was
almost dusk when he arrived at his colonel’s
bungalow and was met by Mrs. Cornwall in the
verandah.</p>

<p>“She will be in the drawing-room directly,” she
whispered mysteriously. “She has had a cup of
tea, and is taking off her hat; the <i>Chusan</i> came
in before her time.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of her, Mrs. Cornwall?”
asked Tom impulsively, colouring as he spoke.
“Isn’t she the prettiest girl you ever saw?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Mrs. Cornwall coughed nervously, and replied,
“Never mind all that <i>now</i>. Go into the drawing-room.
<i>I</i> shall not intrude. Mind, you are to
come to dinner.”</p>

<p>Tom passed onward without another word. The
drawing-room was darkish, but he made out a
slim white figure, that rose quickly at his entrance;
ere he could distinguish more she was
folded in his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! dear Tom!” she exclaimed rapturously.</p>

<p><i>What</i> voice was this? He drew back instinctively,
and met Miss Browne’s cold grey eyes smiling
up into his face; he glanced sharply round the
room and faltered out, “Where—where is she—where
is Lily?”</p>

<p>“Why, dearest? What an <i>odd</i> question! She
is at home, of course, at Clifton.”</p>

<p>“Not—not—coming?” he stammered. As the
awful situation assumed a mental shape his very
blood seemed turned to ice.</p>

<p>“No—certainly not. We shall be <i>far</i> happier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
by ourselves, dear, and you said nothing about
her—never named her.”</p>

<p>“Never named her?” Was he going stark
staring mad?</p>

<p>“By-and-by we will have her out, and get her
married, if we can!” and she laughed as much as
to say, “Easier said than done!”</p>

<p>It was dusk—the expression of amazement,
horror, and dismay which passed over Tom’s features
during this remarkable scene were completely
lost on Miss Browne. Happy Miss
Browne!</p>

<p>“Tom,” she said, “how odd you are! But you
<i>were</i> always rather silent and undemonstrative.
Are you not glad to see me? Think of the thousands
of miles <i>I</i> have come to see <i>you</i>.” And as
she spoke she laid her head confidingly against his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I—I—was out in the sun to-day, and my head
feels queer,” he said, drawing back.</p>

<p>Poor Tom was going through the most awful
moment of his life, and surely an unrivalled experience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
But Tom was a gentleman, and could not
bring himself to divulge the real truth.</p>

<p>“You must be tired,” he stammered with a
desperate effort. “I’ll see you again, at dinner.”
And without further remark he walked hastily out
of the room.</p>

<p>“Hullo! What’s <i>this</i>?” inquired Jack Murray,
as to his intense amazement he discovered his
friend sitting in his bedroom, before his dressing-table.
“Back already! Why are you not sunning
yourself in the smiles of beauty?”</p>

<p>Then he caught a glimpse of his friend’s face.
It was ghastly white. And, lo! on the table
before him were arranged a revolver, and a case
of razors!</p>

<p>“I’m taking my choice,” said Tom in a hoarse
voice. “It must be one or the other.”</p>

<p>Jack Murray was justly alarmed at the expression
of his eye, but did not lose his head for a
second.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked coolly, reaching over
and pocketing the razors. “The sun, acting on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
confirmed softening of the brain? or have you had
a row <i>already</i>?”</p>

<p>“Row! Listen to me, Jack. I went over to see
Lily, as I thought——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and as <i>I</i> thought,” echoed Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, she was not there; but the aunt was.
There’s been some infernal mistake, and <i>she</i> has
come out to marry me.”</p>

<p>When Jack Murray heard this appalling statement,
he stared for a second, and then threw himself
on his friend’s camp cot, and gave vent to a
succession of yells of laughter.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his comrade, very sternly, “play to
you, and death to me.”</p>

<p>After another violent paroxysm, Jack sat up,
dried his eyes on his coat-cuffs, and said quite
seriously—</p>

<p>“You are in a tight place <i>this</i> time, and no
mistake. What on earth are you to do?”</p>

<p>“Shoot myself!” was the brief reply.</p>

<p>“Rubbish! Stop a moment, I have an idea!”</p>

<p>“What good is an <i>idea</i>?” said Tom, scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Promise to place yourself in my hands, and
I’ll guarantee to get you out of this business
<i>alive</i>!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! the woman is here; cake, trousseau,
and all complete. Lily, of course, is done with
me. When the story is known I shall be the
laughing-stock of India. If I don’t marry her
she will bring an action, as sure as fate. No, no.
<i>My</i> idea is, a touch of the sun. Grove, the
doctor, is a good chap. He’ll say it was that.
I’ve been on the ranges all day—a touch of the
sun, and this,” taking up the revolver as he concluded.</p>

<p>“Put it down,” said his friend, angrily. “Listen
to me. We must go over there to dinner, and to-morrow
you shall go on the sick list, and stay
there. All I want is <i>time</i>.”</p>

<p>Jack dared not leave his friend alone in his
present condition (suicidal), and after a long and
exciting altercation he prevailed on him to accompany
him over to the colonel’s. Tom looked
white, haggard, and miserable; anything but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
impersonation of a happy lover. He sat beside
his bride-elect, nobly representing “the death’s-head
at the feast”—his bride, who was dressed in
a marvellous French toilette of white brocade,
whose ears, throat, and fingers glittered with diamonds,
and who was in exuberant spirits. The
company were greatly surprised at Tom Galway’s
idea of “a pretty girl of nineteen,” but politely
dissembled their amazement. Possibly Tom was
more worldly wise than they had supposed. “The
old girl”—such was their profane definition—had
evidently lots of money; but Tom was a deadly
failure as a lover; however, if Miss Browne was
satisfied, there was no more to be said!</p>

<p>After dinner there was a little music. Tom sat
beside his <i>fiancée</i> on a conspicuous sofa, and
looked as if he was awaiting execution, or was
thinking of all his dead relations. Jack played
the banjo, and sang, “Mary had a Little Lamb,”
and various other silly songs, and presently the
guests went away. Mrs. Cornwall thoughtfully
manœuvred so as to leave the lovers to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
their adieux alone. Unhappy Tom! He walked
abruptly over to “the wrong Miss Browne,” held
out a limp hand, and said good night, whereupon
she rose, and looked as if she was going to fall on
his neck, and he turned precipitately and fled.</p>

<p>The next day Tom was in high fever—in real
earnest. A touch of the sun on the ranges. His
head was shaved, and an hospital nurse procured.
Of course Miss Browne was tenderly anxious, and
very much grieved and concerned, but she saw no
reason to sit in sackcloth and ashes. She had
seen other specimens of the officers of the Pioneers,
and began to think she was rather throwing herself
away upon Tom Galway! She had met Major
Pratt at a dinner-party at the general’s—quite a
little impromptu affair—and he had noted the new
arrival with interest. Her income (trebled) had
been casually imparted to him by Jack Murray
as a profound secret. Three thousand a year!
What luck for Tom Galway! If <i>he</i> had only had
such a chance—and the money was undoubtedly
there, for she talked intelligently of funds, shares,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
and mortgages. Her diamonds were valuable,
her dresses costly. She was not half bad-looking
either. He affected deep sympathy for her and
Tom. “Lucky Tom!” he exclaimed; “what
envy, hatred, and malice he had stirred up in
Blazapore!” He sat close to her, and administered
neat little speeches and sugared compliments,
and entreated her to look out for a wife
for him, and when she went away he squeezed her
hand. The next day he called, and the next day
he called and brought a bouquet, and the next
day he called and brought a book, and the following
day a tiger-skin. He damned Tom Galway
with the faintest praise. “He was good-looking.
Yes! but—now she must not fly at him—heavy,
good-natured, but densely stupid. Rather a butt,
you know, and indeed only for him (Major Pratt)
would have got into one or two very nasty
scrapes.” The major had made up his mind to
marry Miss Browne, and was calmly confident of
his ultimate success. Tom Galway was <i>hors de
combat</i>, and all is fair in love and war, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
end it came to pass that Major Pratt prevailed
and carried off the prize! The little Miss Browne
had seen of Tom had not impressed her favourably;
his shaven head, long bony hands, shabby
clothes, and gaunt appearance afforded a painful
contrast to the spruce, agreeable little major.
Moreover, <i>he</i> was a field officer and not a junior
captain, and a far more suitable match in every
respect. In an incredibly short time Jack Murray’s
anticipations were realized. A few honeyed
speeches, a few drives with the major in Jack’s
dog-cart, a few bouquets and cheap but judicious
presents, and Miss Browne had exercised her sex’s
privilege and changed her mind! She wrote a
long letter of apology to Tom, deploring her own
cruelty and his broken heart, praying that <i>time</i>
would alleviate his misery, and pleading, as extenuating
circumstances, Major Pratt’s irresistible
fascinations and her woman’s weakness. That
same evening she and the major ran away together.
No one gave chase,—and they were
ultimately married by special licence in Madras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Jack lost no time in bearing the great news to
his friend. All Blazapore was quivering with the
shock. That mercenary little wretch the major
had carried off Tom Galway’s heiress. Unlucky
Tom!</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Tom; here’s your release,”
holding up the letter that cried “Peccavi.” It
had been consigned to Jack as a matter of course,
he being the major’s chief adviser and confidant.
“She’s in the regiment. I could not help that;
we had to sacrifice <i>some one</i>, and the major
deserved it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack,” said his friend, wringing his hand
till the tears stood in Jack’s eyes, “you have saved
my reason, and my life.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish! If you had allowed <i>me</i> to draft the
first letter there would have been none of this
bother. Served you jolly well right for addressing
it to <i>Miss</i> Browne.”</p>

<p>“She might have known,” stammered Tom.
“She could not have thought that I meant <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“There’s no saying. No fool like an old one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
You wrote again last mail, did you not? Wrote to
the right one! I’ll take good care to see you
turned off myself this time. In a couple of
months your hair will have grown, and you’ll be
fit to be seen, and then you can go down to Bombay
and marry the other Miss Browne.”</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Gregson</span>, Esq., B.S.C., political agent
to the Rajah of Oonomore (a child of seven
years of age), and Percy Goring, his junior assistant,
were travelling from their own state to
attend the great Delhi durbar. Mr. Gregson
was a civilian of twenty-five years’ standing,
short of neck, short of stature, and short of
temper. His red face, pale prominent eyes, and
fierce bushy brows had gained for him the nickname
of “The Prawn;” but he was also known
as a marvellously clever financier, ambitious,
shrewd, and prompt in action; and by those
who were under him, he was less loved than
feared. Young Goring was just twenty-six, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
much more eager to discuss good shooting, or a
good dance, than the assessment of land, the
opium trade, or even acting allowances!</p>

<p>The pair journeyed with due ceremony on the
native state line, and in the little Rajah’s own
gilt and royal carriage. <i>He</i> was laid up in the
palace with chicken-pock, and had wept sorely
because he had been unable to accompany his
guide, philosopher, and friend to the grand
“Tamasha,” to wear his new velvet coat, and
all his jewels, and to hear the guns, that would
thunder in his honour. Child as he was, he was
already keenly sensitive respecting his salute!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the agent and his subordinate got
on capitally without him, travelling at the
leisurely rate of ten miles an hour, that fine
November afternoon, surrounded with tiffin-baskets,
cigarettes, ice-boxes, and other luxurious
accompaniments. About four o’clock the train
came to a sudden standstill—there was no station
to account for this, merely a country road, a
white gate, and a mud hut. The halt resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
itself into a full step; Mr. Gregson thrust his
red face out of the window, and angrily inquired
the reason of the delay.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir,” said the Eurasian
guard, “there has been a break on the line—bridge
gone—and we can’t get forward nohow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gregson glanced out on the prospect—the
dusty cactus hedge, the white telegraph posts, the
expanse of brownish grass, black goats, and jungle.</p>

<p>“Any village, any dâk bungalow?” demanded
the political agent, who might have known better
than to ask.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, your honour. If your honour
will wait here, we will send a messenger to the
next station on foot, and tell them to telegraph
for another train from the junction. This will
arrive at the other side of the break, and take
you on about twelve o’clock to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile we are to sit here!” cried
Mr. Gregson, indignantly. “A pretty state of
affairs! I’ll send a memo to the railway engineer
that will astonish him,” he said, turning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Goring. “It’s four now, and we shall be here
till twelve o’clock to-morrow, if we don’t mind.
We shall be late for the durbar, and I shall
have to wire, ‘unavoidably absent.’”</p>

<p>“I wonder if there is any sport to be had?”
said Goring, descending from the carriage, and
stretching his long legs. “Any shooting, any
black buck?” looking at the guard interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Ah, that reminds me!” exclaimed Mr. Gregson.
“The Rajah has a hunting box somewhere
in these parts—Kori; we can go there for
the night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour,” assented a listener, with
profound respect; “but it is four koss from here—a
‘Kutcha’ road—and a very poor part of the
state.”</p>

<p>“I vote we stop here,” said Goring. “We can
shoot a bit, and come back and dine, and sleep
in the train. We shall be all right and jolly;
twice as comfortable as in some tumble-down old
summer-house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“I shall go to Kori, at any rate,” rejoined his
superior officer, who resented opposition. “The
place is kept up, and I’ve never seen it. This
will be a capital opportunity to inspect it.”</p>

<p>“But it’s four koss away; and how are we
to get our baggage, and bedding, and grub
over?”</p>

<p>“Coolies,” was the laconic rejoinder. “Get
them ready to start at once”—to his head servant,
with an imperious wave of his hand.</p>

<p>“There is no way of transport for your
majesty,” said his obsequious bearer with a deep
salaam. “No ponies, not even an ekka—unless
the ‘Protector of the Poor’ would stoop to a
country cart?” (Which same is a long rude
open basket, between two round wooden wheels,
and drawn by a pair of bullocks.)</p>

<p>“I really think it is hardly worth while to
move,” urged Goring, as he cast a greedy eye
in the direction of a promising snipe jheel. “It
will be an awful fag, and you know you hate
walking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“You can please yourself, and stay here,” said
Mr. Gregson, with immense dignity, who, if he
hated walking, liked his own way.</p>

<p>As the whole suite (not to mention the commissariat)
were bound to accompany him, Goring was
compelled to submit; he dared not run counter to
his arbitrary companion, who, rejecting with scorn
the lowly vehicle that had been suggested, set
out for Kori on foot, whither a long string of
coolies had already preceded him. The sandy
country road wound over a barren, melancholy-looking
tract, diversified with scanty pasture and
marshy patches (or jheels), pools of water, tall
reeds, and brown grasses. It was dotted with
droves of lean cattle, paddy-birds, milk-white
herons, and cranes—especially the tall sirius
family, who danced to one another in a stately,
not to say solemn, fashion.</p>

<p>Truly a bleak, desolate-looking region, and,
save one or two miserable huts and some thorn
bushes, there was no sign of tree or human
habitation. At last they came in sight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
wretched village—the once prosperous hanger-on
of the now deserted hunting palace—that showed
its delicate stone pinnacles behind a high wall;
apparently it stood in an enclosure of vast extent,
an enclosure that must have cost lakhs of rupees.
Two sahibs were naturally an extraordinary sight
in this out-of-the-way district; the fame and
name of Mr. Gregson, a Burra-Burra sahib, had
been spread before him by the coolies, therefore
beggars and petitioners swarmed eagerly round
this great and all-powerful personage.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregson liked to feel his own importance
at a durbar, or an official dinner, but it was quite
another matter to have it thrust upon him by a
gang of clamouring paupers—the maimed, the
halt, the blind—crying out against taxation,
imploring alms, and mercy. He was a hard
man, with a quick, impatient temper. An aged
blind beldame got in his way, and he struck her
savagely with his stick. She shrank back with a
sharp cry, and Goring, who was ever known as “a
sahib with a soft heart,” spoke to her and gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
her a rupee—a real rupee; it was years since
she had felt one!</p>

<p>“Although she is blind, sahib, beware of her,”
said an officious youth, with his hair in a top-not.
“She has the evil eye!”</p>

<p>“Peace, dog!” she screamed; then to Goring,
“I am a lone old woman; my kindred are dead—I
have lived too long. I remember the former
days—rich days; but bad days. Sahib, if you
would be wise, go not to the palace Khana.”</p>

<p>Goring was moving on when the hag hastily
clutched him by the sleeve, and added in a rasping
whisper—</p>

<p>“<i>If you see her face—you die!</i>”</p>

<p>“She is mad,” he said to himself, as he
hastened to join Mr. Gregson, who had arrived
at the great iron-studded gates in a state of
crimson fury.</p>

<p>“You say we have land—true!” shouted a
haggard, wild-eyed ryot; “but what is land without
crops? What is a remission of five per cent.
to wretches like us? It is but as a carraway seed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
in a camel’s mouth! The wild beasts take our
cattle and destroy our grain, and yet we must work
and pay you, and starve! Would that the Rajah
was a man grown! Would that <i>you</i> were dead!”</p>

<p>Mr. Gregson hurried inside, and banged the
great gate violently in the face of the importunate
crowd.</p>

<p>“It is a very poor district, and much too
heavily assessed,” said Goring to himself. “There
is not even a pony in the place. The very
Bunnia is in rags; the deer eat the crops,
such as they are, since the deer are preserved,
and there is no one now to shoot them. It is
abominable!”</p>

<p>The palace was a pretty, light stone building,
two stories in height, with a tower at either end,
and a double verandah all the way round. In
front of it a large space was paved with blocks
of white marble, which ran the whole length of
the building, and it was surrounded by the most
exquisite gardens, kept up in perfect order—doubtless
by the taxes wrung from the wretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
creatures outside its gates—a garden that was
never entered by its proprietor or enjoyed by any
one from year’s end to year’s end, save the
mallee’s children and the monkeys. The monkeys
ate the fruit, the roses and lilies bloomed unseen,
the fountains dripped unheeded; it was a paradise
for the doves and squirrels, like a garden in a
fairy tale.</p>

<p>The chokedar and head mallee (<i>he</i> was a rich
man) received their great guest with every expression
of humble delight. Dinner was prepared
with much bustle in the hall of audience, whilst
Mr. Gregson and his junior explored. There
were long shady walks paved with white marble,
immense bushes of heliotrope and myrtle, delicate
palms, fine mango trees, peach trees, and orange
trees. It was truly an oasis in the desert when
one contrasted it with the bare, desolate, barren
country that lay outside its walls.</p>

<p>“I shall bring the little chap here,” said Mr.
Gregson, pompously. “We will have a camp here
at Christmas.” And then he strolled back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
palace, and made an excellent dinner of roast
turkey, and asparagus, and champagne.</p>

<p>After this repast he got out his despatch-box
and his cigarette-case, and set about writing an
official, whilst Goring took a chair, and adjourned
to the marble pavement outside the palace.</p>

<p>It was an exquisite night; a low moon was peering
over the wall—the air was heavy with the scent
of syringa and orange blossoms; there was not a
sound, not a voice to be heard, not a soul in sight,
save Mr. Gregson, who, illuminated by two wax
candles, bent eagerly over his pen, as he sat in
the open hall of audience.</p>

<p>Goring, as he smoked, thought of many things;
of the half-famished villagers; of the splendid
shooting that was going to waste; of the grand
bag he could make, and would make, at Christmas.
Then he began sleepily to recall some stories—half-told
stories—about this very place; tales of
hideous atrocities, and crimes that had been done
here, in the days of the Tiger Rajah, the present
ruler’s grandfather. He was gradually dozing off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
when he was aroused by the sounds of distant tom-toms,
playing with extravagant spirit. The drumming
came slowly nearer and nearer; it actually
seemed to be in the garden—louder and louder—with
a whispered murmuring and low applause, and
as it were the footsteps of a great multitude. But
there was nothing whatever to be seen, and it was
as light as day. He moved uneasily in his chair,
and gazed behind him; no! nothing to be seen
but his senior steadily covering sheets of foolscap.
He turned his head, and was aware of an unexpected
sight—as startling as it was uncanny! Two
twinkling little brown feet, dancing before him on
the marble pavement! exquisite feet, that seemed
scarcely to touch the ground, and that kept perfect
time to the inspiriting sounds of the tom-toms; they
were decked with massive golden anklets, which
tinkled as they moved, and above them waved a
few inches of the heavy yellow gold-embroidered
skirt of the dancing-girl. No more was visible.
Round and round the fairy feet flitted, in a very
poetry of motion; faster and faster played the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
tom-toms. Such dancing, such nimble feet, it had
never been young Goring’s lot to behold! Yes—but
where was the rest of the body?</p>

<p>As he gazed in half-stupefied amazement, he
suddenly recalled the old hag’s warning, with an
unpleasant thrill—</p>

<p>“If you see her face—you <i>die</i>!”</p>

<p>At this instant there was a scraping sound, of
the pushing back of a chair, of slow footsteps on
the marble, of a loud cry, and a heavy fall.</p>

<p>Goring jumped up, and beheld Mr. Gregson
lying prone on his face. He rushed to his assistance,
and raised him with considerable difficulty.
His eyes were fixed with an expression of unutterable
horror. He gave one or two shuddering
gasps, his head drooped forward on his breast,
and he expired.</p>

<p>Goring looked round apprehensively. The feet
had disappeared; the tom-toms had ceased.</p>

<p>He shouted for help, and immediately a vast

him, and Babel ensued.</p>

</div></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">If</span> any one can help you, it will be Captain
Blane.”</p>

<p>This sentence was uttered by a smart young
clerk, in a shipping office in Rangoon, who, clothed
in cool white drill, leant his elbows confidentially
on the desk, and concluded his speech with a
reassuring nod.</p>

<p>I was <i>en route</i> from Upper Burmah to Singapore,
in order to attend my sister’s wedding. Our
flat river-boat was late, and when I presented
myself at the booking-office of the P. and O., I
found to my dismay that the steamer for the
Straits had sailed at dawn, and that there would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
not be another for a week! I was therefore bound
to miss the wedding, and waste my precious leave
in Rangoon, thanks to the leisurely old tub that
had dawdled down from Mandalay.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes expectantly on Captain Blane,
a short-necked, weather-beaten sailor, in a blue
serge coat with gilt buttons, and a peaked cap. He
surveyed me steadily, with a pair of small keen
eyes, and evidently did not receive the suggestion
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“We don’t carry passengers,” he announced in
a gruff voice. “My ship is only a cargo-boat, a
tramp; and we have no accommodation whatsoever.”</p>

<p>“No accommodation!” echoed the clerk, incredulously.
“Oh, I say, come!”</p>

<p>“Why, you know very well that all the cabins
are chock-full of cargo; and we have never carried
a passenger since I took command.”</p>

<p>“If there was any hole or corner where you
could stow me, I don’t mind how I rough it,” I
urged; “and I’ll pay full first-class fare.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Oh, there’s lots of holes and corners,” admitted
the captain. “And you’d just get the
ship’s rations, same as the officers and myself;
no soups and <i>entrées</i>—plain roast and boiled.”</p>

<p>“I’m not particular; I’m ready to eat salt
junk and sea biscuit. I’ll do anything, short
of swimming, to get to Singapore by next
Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Is it so <i>very</i> important?” demanded Captain
Blane.</p>

<p>“A wedding. No—no,” in answer to his commiserating
stare, “not my own—but I’ve to give
away the bride.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I suppose I must try and stretch
a point. Mind! I’ll take you at your word about
the passage money. ‘Never refuse a good offer,’
is my motto; so, Mr. ——?” and he paused interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Lawrence is my name.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lawrence, if you’ll be down at Godwin’s
Wharf to-morrow, at nine o’clock, with your baggage
and bedding and servant, we will lie off a bit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
and any sampan will put you aboard in five
minutes. Ask for the <i>Wandering Star</i>;” and with
a nod between the clerk and myself, he turned his
back and stumped out.</p>

<p>“He is not very keen about passengers, eh?”
remarked the clerk with a laugh. “I wonder
why?”</p>

<p>“I suppose because she is a dirty old cargo-boat.
But any port in a storm, or rather, any
ship, in this crisis, for me!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the clerk, rubbing his chin reflectively,
“I’ve a sort of idea—though perhaps I
dreamt it—that there is something rum, or out of
the way, about this <i>Wandering Star</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever it is, I’ll risk it,” I answered
with a laugh, as I followed the captain’s example,
and took my departure.</p>

<p>Punctually at nine o’clock next morning I embarked
in a sampan, and was rowed down the
swift Irrawaddy.</p>

<p>“That cannot be my steamer,” I protested, as
the boatman made for a long, low, raking craft, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
craft of considerable pretensions! She looked like
one of the smaller vessels of the P. and O. fleet.</p>

<p>But sure enough the boatman was right, for as
we passed under her stern, I read in yellow letters
the name—<i>Wandering Star</i>.</p>

<p>A closer inspection showed her to be simply
what her commander had stated—a tramp; she
was dirty, rusty, and travel-stained. When I
clambered aboard, I found no snowy decks, or
shining brasses, but piles of cargo, bustling coolies,
and busy blue-clad lascars. I was immediately
accosted by the captain, who presented me to the
chief officer, and to a fellow-traveller, a sallow,
lanky youth of nineteen, going to join his friends
in the Straits.</p>

<p>“I thought he would be company for you,” explained
the sailor. “We are off in half an hour,”
pointing to the Blue Peter at the fore. “And
we’re loaded to the hatches. Mr. Kelly here will
show you your quarters.”</p>

<p>As I followed the chief officer, I was astonished
at the dimensions of the <i>Star</i>; it was a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
distance from the captain’s snug cabin, near
the bridge, to the poop. We made our way below,
into a long saloon with tables and seats intact,
but the aft part piled high with bales. There was
a strange, musty, mouldy smell; it felt damp and
vault-like, and afforded a sharp contrast to the
blazing sun and cobalt sky on deck.</p>

<p>As my eye became used to the gloom, I noticed
the lavish carving, the handsome mahogany and
brass fittings, the maple-wood doors and panels—the
remains of better days!</p>

<p>My cabin contained two bunks, and in one of
these my servant, a Madras butler, called
“Sawmy,” had already arranged my bedding.</p>

<p>“I wonder you don’t carry passengers?” I
remarked to Mr. Kelly. “What a fine saloon!
I should have thought it would have paid well.”</p>

<p>“She carried hundreds in her day,” he said
complacently. “You see there is where the
piano was hitched, and there the swinging lamps,
and bookcase; but, all the same, it would never
pay <i>us</i> to take passengers;” and he laughed—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
odd sort of laugh. “We are not a regular liner,
you know, trading between two ports. Regular
liners look on us as dirt; but lots of ’em would
give a good deal for our lines, and our engines.
There’s some of them I would not send my old
boots home in! We pick up cargo as we find it;
one time we run to Zanzibar, another to Hong
Kong, another to the Cape, or maybe Sydney.
I’ve not been home this three years. I hope
you’ll find your bunk comfortable; the youngster
is opposite, just across the saloon—you know
your way back!” and having done the honours,
he left me.</p>

<p>Certainly, the <i>Star</i> was much above her present
business, and bore the remains of having seen
better days. Even my marble washstand was not
in keeping with a cargo-steamer. I opened the
next cabin; it was crammed to the door with
freight—bird-cages in this instance. Every cabin
was no doubt similarly packed. I was not sorry
to exchange the earthy, chill atmosphere below
for the bright sunshine on deck. Soon we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
weighed anchor, and were moving smoothly down
the rapid Irrawaddy, between high banks of tawny
grass, gradually losing sight of the shipping, then
of the golden Pagoda, then of Elephant Point;
finally the <i>Star</i> put her nose straight out, to
cross the Gulf of Martaban. The sea was calm,
we were well fed and found, and made a pleasant
party of six; the captain, first and second officers,
the chief engineer, and two passengers. I slept
like a top that night, and awoke next morning,
and found we were anchored off Moulmein, with
its hills covered with pagodas and palms. From
Moulmein we put to sea, and still the weather once
more favoured us. The captain was a capital
companion, full of anecdotes and sea-stories;
the chief engineer was a first-rate chess-player,
and I began to think I had done rather a smart
thing in securing a passage in this stray steamer.
As the captain concluded a thrilling yarn apropos
of a former ship, in which he had been third
officer, I suddenly recalled the shipping clerk’s
hint, and asked—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Are there no stories about this one? has she
no history?”</p>

<p>Captain Blane looked at the chief officer with
a knowing grin, and then replied—</p>

<p>“History?—of course she has. What do you call
the log-book? That’s her history. I suppose that
chap at the office told you she was considered an
unlucky ship? Eh? Come, now, own up!”</p>

<p>“No; but he said he had an idea that there
was something queer about her—he could not
remember what it was.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been in command of her now four
years, and I’ve seen nothing to complain of.
What do you say, Kelly?” appealing to the first
officer.</p>

<p>“I say that I never wish to put foot on a
better sea-boat, and there’s nothing wrong with
her, as far as <i>I</i> know.”</p>

<p>But Sawmy, my Madras boy, entertained a
totally different opinion of the <i>Star</i>. When I
asked him why he did not sleep outside my door
in the saloon, he frankly replied—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Because plenty devil in this ship; the chief
Serang” (head of the Lascars) “telling me that
saloon plenty bad place.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We were now within forty-eight hours of Singapore,
when the weather suddenly changed, as it
frequently does in those treacherous seas. The
awning was taken down—sure presage of a bad
time coming. The ports were closed, and all was
made ready for a blow; and we were not disappointed—it
came. We had a rough night, but I
was not in the least inconvenienced; I slept like
a dormouse rocked in the cradle of the deep.</p>

<p>In the morning my fellow-passenger (whose
name, by the way, was Mellish, and who had
evidently “suffered,” to judge by his ghastly appearance)
accosted me timidly and said—</p>

<p>“Did you get up and walk about last night?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever walk in your sleep?” he continued.</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge—why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“Because last night some one came and
hammered on my cabin door, and shouted, ‘The
ship’s aground.’ What do you think it can
have been?” he asked with a frightful face.</p>

<p>“I think there is no doubt that it was the hot
tinned lobster you had for supper,” I answered
promptly.</p>

<p>“No, no, no, it was not a dream—it woke me,”
he returned. “I thought it was <i>you</i>. Then
I tried to think it was a nightmare, and had
almost brought myself to believe it, and was
dropping off to sleep, when a cold, cold wet hand
was passed slowly across my face;” and he
shuddered violently.</p>

<p>“Lobster!” I repeated emphatically.</p>

<p>“No, no. Oh, Mr. Lawrence, I heard moaning
and whispering and praying. I’m afraid to sleep
in that cabin alone; may I come and share yours?”</p>

<p>“There is no room,” I answered, rather shortly.
“The top berth is crammed full of my things.”</p>

<p>At breakfast there was a good deal of movement,
and now and then a loud splash upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
the deck. The captain, who had been tapping
the barometer, looked unusually solemn, and said—</p>

<p>“We are in for a bit of dirty weather; unless I’m
mistaken, there’s a cyclone somewhere about.
I don’t think we shall do more than touch the edge
of it, and this is a stout craft, so you need not be
uneasy.”</p>

<p>This was vastly reassuring, when the sky to the
west changed from a lowering grey to an inky
black. The wind rose with a whimper, that increased
to a shriek; it lashed the sea with fury,
lashed it into enormous waves, and, laden as we
were, we began to roll, at first majestically, then
heavily, then helplessly. We took in great green
seas over the bows, tons of water discharged themselves
amidships, and made us stagger and groan,
but still through it all the engines thumped
doggedly on.</p>

<p>We seized our dinner anyhow; sitting, standing,
kneeling, adapting ourselves to the momentary
angle of the vessel. It was a miserable evening,
wet and cold, and Mellish and I went to bed early.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
The dead-lights were down, the hatchway closed
behind us; we were entirely cut off from the rest
of our shipmates for the night, and the saloon
smelt more vault-like than ever. I turned away
from Mellish’s grey frightened face, and stammering,
piteous importunities, shut myself into my
cabin, bolted the door, went to bed, and fell asleep.
Meanwhile the storm increased to a hurricane, the
motion was tremendous. I was flung violently out
on the floor, as the <i>Star</i> made one awful plunge,
and then righted herself. I was, needless to state,
now thoroughly awake, and scrambling back into
my berth, and clinging to the woodwork with both
hands, lay listening to the roaring of the tempest,
which rose now and then to a shrill shriek, that
had a terribly human sound; my heart beat fast,
as my ears assured it that I was not merely listening
to the raving of the gale, but actually to the
piercing screams of women, and the hoarse shouts
of men! Just as I had arrived at this amazing
conclusion, the door of the cabin was burst
open, and an elderly man, in his shirt-sleeves, was
hurled in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“She’s going down,” he bawled excitedly, “and
the hatches are fast.”</p>

<p>I sprang up, and the next lurch shot us both out
into the saloon. And what a scene did I behold by
three lamps that swung violently to and fro! Their
fitful light showed me a large number of half-dressed
strangers, in the last extremity of mortal
fear; there was the horrible, selfish pushing and
struggling of a panic-stricken crowd, fighting their
way towards the companion-ladder; the wild
frenzied distraction people exhibit when striving
to escape from some deadly peril; the tumult, the
cries and shrieks of frightened women making
frantic appeals for rescue—cries heart-rending to
hear.</p>

<p>Besides the dense struggling block at one end of
the cabin, battling fiercely for escape, there were
various groups, apparently resigned to their impending
fate. A family at prayer; two men drinking
raw brandy out of tumblers; an ayah beating
her head upon the floor, and calling on “Ramasawmy;”
an old lady, with a shawl over her head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
and a Bible on her knee; a young man and a girl,
hand locked in hand, whispering last words; a
pale woman, with a sleeping child in her arms.
I saw them all. I saw Mellish clinging to the
saloon hand-rail, his eyes glazed with horror, and
gibbering like an idiot.</p>

<p>The crash of broken crockery, the shrieks of
despair, the roaring of the wind, the sullen thundering
of the seas overhead, combined to make up
the most frightful scene that could possibly be
imagined.</p>

<p>Then all at once, a beautiful girl, with long
dark hair, streaming over a white gown, rushed
out of a cabin, and threw herself upon me, flinging
her arms round my neck; she sobbed—</p>

<p>“Oh, save me—save me! Don’t let me die—don’t
let me die!”</p>

<p>Her wild agonized face was pressed closely to
mine; her frantic clasp round my neck tightened
like a band of steel—closer, closer, <i>closer</i>. I was
choking. I could not move or breathe. She was
strangling me, as she shrieked in my ear—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“It is coming now! <i>This is death!</i>”</p>

<p>There was one awful lurch, a grinding crash, a
sinking sensation, a vice-like grip about my throat—and
outer darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I was aroused in broad daylight by Sawmy, who
had brought my tea and shaving-water. I was
lying on the floor of the saloon, and he was
stooping over me, with a frightened expression on
his broad, brown countenance.</p>

<p>“At first I thinking master dead!” was his
candid announcement. “Me plenty fraiding.
Why master lying here and no in bed?” Why
indeed!</p>

<p>A plunge of my head into cool water, and a cup
of tea, brought me to myself, and then I flung on
my dressing-gown, and hurried across the saloon
to see what had become of the miserable Mellish.</p>

<p>He was stretched in his berth, with a life-belt
beside him, rigid and cold, and in a sort of fit.</p>

<p>With brandy, burnt brown paper, and great
difficulty, Sawmy and I brought him round. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
soon as he had come to his senses, and realized
that he was still in the land of the living, he sat
up and turned on me quite ferociously, and said—</p>

<p>“And that’s what you call <i>lobster</i>!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The weather had moderated considerably, and
though I had no great appetite, I was able to
appear at breakfast. Mellish was too shattered
to join us, and lay in a long chair in the deck-house,
sipping beef-tea, and hysterically assuring
all inquirers that “he would never again set foot
in the saloon—no, he would <i>much</i> rather die!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you got knocked about a bit last
night?” inquired the captain, with a searching
glance.</p>

<p>“Not exactly knocked about; I did not mind
<i>that</i> so much, but——” and I hesitated.</p>

<p>“But you were disturbed?” he added significantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, very much so; I hope I shall never be
disturbed in such a way again.”</p>

<p>“Then I take it you’ve seen them—the former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
passengers? They are generally aboard, they say,
in dirty weather.”</p>

<p>“Whatever they were, I trust in God I may
never witness such another scene.”</p>

<p>“You don’t wonder now that we are not free of
offering cabin accommodation, eh? Not that I
ever saw anything myself.”</p>

<p>“But you admit that there <i>is</i> something.”</p>

<p>“So they say”—nodding his head with a
jaunty air.</p>

<p>“And what is the explanation? <i>What</i> do they
say?” I asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“Just this. The <i>Wandering Star</i> was once the
<i>Atalanta</i>, a fine passenger steamer, and, coming
out her last trip, she fell in for the tail of a cyclone,
and came to grief off the Laccadives; blown out of
her course, engine-fires put out, went on a rock,
and sank in ten fathoms; every soul on board went
down, except a steward and a fireman, who got off
on a hen-coop. It was an awful business—sixty-nine
passengers, besides officers and crew. She
sank like a stone, no time to get battered to pieces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and so she was right well worth her salvage. A
company bought her cheap; she was but little
damaged—they raised and sold her. She was intended
for the pilgrim traffic, from Bombay to
Mecca, and in fact she did make a couple of trips;
but somehow she got a bad name; the pilgrims
said she was possessed of devils—ha! ha!—and so
the owners put her into the wheat and rice and
general cargo trade, and we have no complaints.
She has been at it these five years, and is, as I
take you to witness, a grand sea-boat, and has
fine accommodation betweendecks as well as aft;
it’s only in real dirty weather that there is anything
amiss, and that in the saloon. They say,”
lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper, “they kept
the passengers below, battened down; they got no
chance for their lives. It was a mistake; they
were all drowned like rats in their holes. Mind
you, <i>I</i>’ve seen nothing, and I’m not a superstitious
man.”</p>

<p>“Would you sleep in the saloon?” I sternly
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“No; for in a blow <i>my</i> place is on the bridge.
But I’ll not deny that a second officer, who has left
us, tried a bunk down there once, out of curiosity,
and did not repeat the experiment; he was properly
scared;” and the captain chuckled at the recollection.</p>

<p>“I suppose we shall get in to-night?” I remarked,
as we paced the deck together.</p>

<p>“Yes, about eleven o’clock. We are doing our
twelve knots, dirty-looking old hooker as we are!”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” I answered, “for you
will not be surprised to hear that I’m not anxious
to occupy my berth again.”</p>

<p>I am thankful to relate that I slept on land that
same night, and was not “disturbed.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I often glance at the shipping lists, to see if
there is any news of the <i>Wandering Star</i>. I note
that she is still tramping the ocean from China
to Peru, and I have not the smallest doubt but
that, on stormy nights, the saloon is still
crowded with the distracted spectres of her former
passengers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>THE SECRET OF THE AMULET.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“Frailty, thy name is woman!”—<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">People</span> said they were from the north—even from
beyond Peshawar—the two tall men, with fair
skins and long brown hair, but no one had time
to ascertain their name or business, for between
the sunset and dawn both had fallen a prey to that
horrible throat disease that seizes its victims by the
gullet, and strangles them almost on the spot. Thus
they died in the great serai at Hassanpur—leaving
behind them three stout Cabuli ponies, two rolls
of bedding, and one little boy; also, it was whispered
in the bazaar, a considerable sum of money in excellent
Government notes; but this, the policeman
in charge of the serai swore by the soul of his
father, was a black lie, and, with the sanction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the authorities, he made over the child and three
ponies to the keeping of his maternal uncle,
Ibrahim Khan (the same who lives at the corner
of the road as you go to the sugar-works). Ibrahim
sold the ponies to his satisfaction to officers in the
cantonments, and suffered the child to share his
roof, and also his extremely frugal fare. An Indian
community is never slow to talk, and it was
breathed from ear to ear, that the traders had
been wealthy, and that Nubbi Bux, the policeman,
and Ibrahim, his kinsman, had divided the spoil
between them. One thing was manifest: nought
had descended to Kareem, the rightful heir!</p>

<p>He was a fair-skinned little fellow, with dancing
dark eyes, who ran about the roads almost naked,
with an old flat copper amulet tied round his neck
by a piece of string; he was about four years of
age, as pretty as a bronze Cupid; the women
petted him for his good looks, and he found many
congenial playfellows among the narrow alleys and
courtyards of the swarming <i>burra bazar</i>. Ibrahim,
Kareem’s adopted grandfather, was an avaricious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
old person, with a hooked nose, pendulous underlip,
and frowsy turban, who sat all day long in a shop
like a niche—it looked no bigger than a wardrobe—lined
with empty jars, bottles, broken lamps,
cracked cups and saucers, and battered odd volumes
of worthless books. He did not sell much, but he
served market people with pulls at a huka, at a
fixed price; and he was reputed to lend money at
enormous interest.</p>

<p>If you know the city of Hassanpur, where it lies
between two capricious rivers, and surrounded by
a vast grain country, you must be familiar with
the long red bridge over the Kanat, on the parapet
of which a mendicant sits, who rests not from
dawn till dusk calling, “Blind man—blind man.”
Just at the foot of the bridge is the great serai, or
wayside house, for travellers, with its lofty walls,
spacious inclosure, and entrance gate worthy of a
mosque—both it and the bridge were built by a
rich native, who wished his name to go down to
posterity; but to thousands who cross the one, and
hundreds who halt at the other, it is unknown—no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
doubt they imagine both to be the work of the
all-powerful and ever-active Sircar (Government).</p>

<p>Kareem’s tastes did not lean to trade; far from
it! he had no aptitude in bargaining for kid skins,
empty bottles, and kerosine oil tins. On the other
hand, he had an uncontrollable passion for horses,
and when he grew too old to build houses in the
dust, and play baby games, he used to hang about
the serai and haunt the society of camel-drivers
and horse-dealers. He soon became acquainted
with the manners and customs of the divers kinds
of beasts that crowded the inclosure; camels, ekka
ponies, buffaloes, mules, elephants, and squealing
country-breds. He knew all their peculiarities,
and was not afraid of one of them. Many and
many a time, he played truant from the munshi
and his lessons, and many a time his angry grandfather
sought him with a stick, and drove him forth
with blows and curses; but now—Kareem was a
smart lad of eighteen, and useful to traders and
travellers. Moreover he earned money, and Ibrahim
viewed his visits to the serai with extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
complacency. Within the last ten years he had
become a well-known and popular character. New
arrivals and regular <i>habitués</i> immediately shouted
for “Kareem, Kareem.” He was a person of far
more importance than the sleepy policeman in
charge—not his original patron, who had picked
him up from between two dead men, and placed
him out in the world!</p>

<p>One hot April evening, as Kareem squatted idly
at the serai entrance, enjoying a huka and a
“bukk” with a lad of his own age, he noticed a
cloud of white dust whirling down the bridge. No—it
was not driven by the wind, but caused by a
wild runaway. In a second he had recognized the
collector’s little boy, on his chestnut pony, racing
towards him at break-neck pace—a huge lumbering
camel carriage had frightened the overfed,
pampered Tattoo, and he was making for home at
a mad gallop. Kareem stood up, and dashed into
the road; he was lithe and active as a hunting
leopard. As the pony passed, he sprang at it, like
a starving beast of prey, clung to its neck, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
ran alongside until he had effectually checked its
career, but only just in time—only just before it
turned the sharp corner into the bazaar. The
collector now rode up; his face grey with fear. He
knew too well what would have been the child’s
fate, had the fiery little animal bolted through
those narrow streets, impassable with ekkas and
bullock carts, and he shuddered as he wiped the
perspiration from his face, and tendered Kareem
his tremulous thanks. But empty thanks were
not to be his sole portion. As he attached a leading
rein from the pony’s bridle to the collector’s
shaking hand, that gentleman said, “Let me see
you to-morrow morning at nine o’clock,” and then
the pair trotted soberly away.</p>

<p>Mr. Colebrook, the collector, lived in a fine square
flat-roofed bungalow, about two miles from the
city, in the civil lines. It stood in a spacious compound
studded with fine trees, and was approached
by a winding gravelled avenue. Kareem went up
this avenue, slowly and doubtfully; he was not in
the habit of frequenting such grand dwellings, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
presently he came to a dead halt, and sat down at
a respectful distance, under a cork tree; and here
the collector saw him, and beckoned him from his
office verandah.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Colebrook to himself, “a fine
frank face, and surely not a native of these parts.”</p>

<p>In answer to a question, Kareem replied—</p>

<p>“No, your worship, I am from the north—so
they say.”</p>

<p>“They say?” echoed the gentleman. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“My father died in the serai fifteen years ago,
your honour; no one knew his name or country;
and old Ibrahim took me; he says I am a Cabuli
or a Cashmeri. God knows.”</p>

<p>“And what is your occupation?”</p>

<p>“By your honour’s favour, I work in the serai,
and earn from one rupee to four rupees a month,
according to the season.”</p>

<p>“Then you understand horses.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”—his face lighting up—“by your favour,
yes; and I can ride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Then, I will take you on as syce for my son’s
pony—the one you caught yesterday.”</p>

<p>Kareem salaamed to the very matting.</p>

<p>“Your pay will be seven rupees a month and
clothes.”</p>

<p>Now, six rupees is a man’s pay, and Kareem
was but eighteen. Kareem’s heart was too full
for words; he was almost overcome, and on the
very verge of tears. All his comrades knew that
he was an odd, excitable boy, and laughed and
cried like a woman! His feet seemed scarcely to
touch the ground; he sped along as if they had
wings, and he was a second Mercury carrying
home the great news—first over the wide white
roads, then across the railway, and finally he
plunged into the bazaar.</p>

<p>Kareem ran along at a sling trot, hustling and
thrusting his slim body through the densely-packed
thoroughfares; at last he arrived at home and
panted out his marvellous tidings to old Ibrahim.
That patriarch received the intelligence with so
many exclamations of “Oh, ye fathers!” and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
much clawing of his beard, that Kareem felt
assured that he had been handsomely launched in
life, and was indeed a man of considerable importance;
he lost no time, that same evening, in
hurrying to the bridge (a kind of local Rialto) and
there expounding his success to a curious and
envious crowd of listening friends. Among the
crowd was Pera, Ibrahim’s grand-niece, Kareem’s
former playmate—and present idol. She was four
years younger than him by months and days, but
thirty years his senior in experience, in worldly
wisdom, and in wickedness. Undoubtedly she was
extremely pretty, with wondrously-traced arched
brows, red lips, and eloquent black eyes. Nevertheless
her grand-uncle detested her, and most of
her own sex bore her unconcealed animosity; they
declared, “She was as false as the devil, deep as
the pit, and as dangerous as a snake with a head
at both ends.” People hinted that Abdool, her
father, was in debt to his uncle Ibrahim; and also
that Pera was promised in marriage to Mindoo, her
cousin, a handsome hawk-eyed man, with a scar on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
his cheek and minus one finger. There was some
mystery about Mindoo. Once, he had been absent
for three whole years, and it was an unexplained
absence; for it was mere foolishness for his brothers
to say that he had joined a horse-dealer and had
gone down to Allahabad. Does it take three years
to sell a dozen ponies?</p>

<p>Mindoo was a stalwart, taciturn man, and somewhat
feared; therefore no one called him a budmash
to his face, or even in the ears of his kindred.
He worked with a carpenter who mended ekkas
and gharries, and was clever with the chisel and
the saw. Nevertheless, people whispered that he
had never learnt this trade at Hassanpur in his
youth—but in Allahabad jail khana.</p>

<p>Pera was among Kareem’s audience, and listened,
with unaffected interest, to the particulars of his
rise in life. He had been her slave ever since she
could speak, and now most of his scanty earnings
went to gratify her taste for cocoanut-sweets and
coloured glass bangles. “You will not scorn me
now, Pera,” he pleaded, as they loitered together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
near the tamarind tree. “Behold, I am in the
collector sahib’s service. I am to have seven
rupees and clothes. I have as much wages as
Mindoo!” But Pera only peeped coquettishly
round the corner of her orange saree, laughed
saucily, and ran away.</p>

<p>Kareem was soon installed in his new post, and
wearing a smart blue suit and gorgeous red turban,
felt the sense of personal importance accruing from
new garments, when he encountered his old friends.
His duties proved to be trifling in comparison to
his drudgery in the serai, though, now and then,
he had enjoyed the fierce, mad delight of mounting
some unbroken colt, and galloping it bare-backed
over the bridge, away along the Lucknow road,
between the waving elephant grass, past little
brown houses with pumpkins on the roof, past
pools half filled with hideous blue buffaloes, scattering
children, pariah dogs, and goats, as if he was
mounted on a whirlwind, and riding on the storm.</p>

<p>Here, he had merely to groom and feed an
irritable little chestnut pony, no bigger than a calf;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to lead out the “lal Tattoo,” as Harry Sahib
called it, with its master on its back, of a morning
over the dewy maidans and along the shady roads.
He ran with it as it cantered, and even galloped,
though once or twice he was suddenly obliged to
stop, and lean against a tree, his face grey and
drawn, and groan aloud with agony (he had,
though he knew it not, advanced disease of the
heart); he would earnestly beseech Harry Sahib
not to tell the collector, and, as a bribe, would hold
Harry Sahib in the saddle, whilst he piloted him
over tiny nullahs, to that young gentleman’s huge
delight. The little boy spoke Hindustani as his
native tongue, and soon he and his syce became
sworn and intimate friends. Harry Sahib had no
mother, only a lazy, elderly European nurse, who
liked her beer, her slumbers, and her ease, and was
secretly thankful to Kareem for taking the brat off
her hands. Otherwise, Harry Sahib might not
have spent so many happy hours about the stables,
whilst his unsuspecting papa was absent at Cutcherry.
One day, whilst he was romping with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
playmate, and rolling over and over with him in
piles of “bedding straw,” he suddenly snatched at
a cord round his neck, and a copper amulet came
off in his hand. They fought for it for fully five
minutes. Harry held it tight in his little fist, and
screamed and kicked and even <i>bit</i>, but refused to
release it; in the struggle the amulet was broken,
and a small piece of parchment fell out, which
Kareem instantly pounced on. It was about two
inches long by one wide, and was covered on
both sides with closely-written quaint characters.
Kareem, with much abuse and slippering, had
learned to read the Koran and part of the Gulistan
of Sadi, but never such letters as these!</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Harry Sahib, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I cannot say, Hazoor. I never knew it opened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get it mended, the brass thing; but
can you read the chit inside?”</p>

<p>“No, not this writing.”</p>

<p>“Let me show it to father; he can read anything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Yes, his honour is a learned pundit, but I will
not trouble him,” said Kareem, independently.</p>

<p>He thought he would rather take it, and have it
explained by a Moulvi in a bazaar, nearer home.
But in all the city quarter, was not found one man
who could translate it, though passed from hand
to hand, and learned patriarchs in horn spectacles
pored over it, peered into it, turned it backwards
and forwards, and upside down, and decided that
it was in some dead tongue, and doubtless was a
charm against Jadoo (Magic) or the Evil Eye!
Finally, Kareem fell back on his young master’s
advice, and, with much salaaming and many
apologies, submitted the little scrap to the collector.
Mr. Colebrook examined it carefully through his
glasses, and then by means of a microscope, and
asked Kareem “how he came by it?”</p>

<p>“Protector of the Poor, it is all I possess, and
was round my throat as an infant.”</p>

<p>The collector was very busy just at this time
and said, “As soon as I have any leisure, Kareem,
I will see what I can make of this,” and Kareem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
withdrew with profuse thanks. For so long did
his master ponder over the parchment, that
Kareem’s hopes faded away, and he had almost
forgotten the amulet, and believed its contents to
be a myth. But one day, at the end of the rains,
he was summoned into the collector’s office. That
gentleman was alone, and, rising, closed the door,
and beckoning to Kareem to come near, said
rather mysteriously, “I have had great difficulty
in making it out”—showing the writing.
“Indeed I had nearly given it up; but at last
I got a clue, and I have read it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, your highness.”</p>

<p>“You must keep what I am going to read to
you a secret”—Kareem’s eyes sparkled. “It is
for your own good, and now listen,” lowering his
voice to a whisper. “This”—displaying the scrap—“is
in ancient Persian characters, and relates
to a treasure that has been buried for more than
three hundred years.” Kareem endeavoured to
speak, but failed to articulate. “Yes—apparently
some of the spoils of Mahommed of Guznee, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
took and conquered the Punjab, and made twelve
raiding expeditions into Hindustan. Doubtless
this is some loot that the victors failed to carry off
and concealed—possibly they were hotly pursued.</p>

<p>“It says”—now taking off his glasses and
applying a microscope to his eye and reading
very slowly—“‘Eighty <i>koss</i> north from Hassanpur,
on the edge of the Goomptee river, that is within
fifty paces, near the great bridge and between
milestone and saal tree, I, Fateh Din, bury a
rich store of jewels and gold, by reason of one
camel being sorely wounded and the enemy
pressing on fast. May Allah preserve it for me
and mine!’”</p>

<p>The syce’s eyes seemed double their usual size,
his face worked with emotion, he could not
speak; he could only gasp and sob as the collector
went on—</p>

<p>“This is the catalogue, only a partial one
apparently,” turning and reading the reverse of
the parchment.</p>

<p>“‘Two <i>khantas</i> (necklaces) of rubies and pearls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
very large. Four <i>sirpech</i> (forehead ornaments) of
diamonds. Twelve <i>bazabands</i> (armlets) of choice
emeralds. Five <i>turals</i> (plumes) of great brilliants.
One coat embroidered in seed pearls, five gold
stirrups.’</p>

<p>“You must keep silent as the grave, Kareem,”
said his master, laying down the microscope.
“It is possible that there is a quantity of gold
coin as well as jewels. The list seems broken off
suddenly; it remains entirely with yourself to
be a rich man, and if you would be wealthy, be
silent. I am going into that part of the district
this cold weather. Can you hold your tongue
for two months?”</p>

<p>“I can, sahib,” faltered Kareem, who was
trembling all over.</p>

<p>“I think I know the place—the bridge was
destroyed forty years ago, but its piers are still
standing; the old road, too, has fallen into disuse
since we have the railway and canal, but I believe
I can put my hand on the very spot, between the
saal tree and the milestone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“And will all this treasure be <i>mine</i>?” whispered
Kareem.</p>

<p>“Yes, since you claim it by the writing, which
has doubtless been in your family for many generations.
Possibly your father was in search of
this treasure when he died.”</p>

<p>“Yes, most true, your highness.”</p>

<p>“Only for this paper in your possession, it
would be claimed and recovered by Government.”</p>

<p>“May I tell my grandfather, Ibrahim Khan?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you may—that is, if he is a cautious
man; but mind this, Kareem, to no one else;
above all, to no <i>woman</i>.”</p>

<p>“No fear, your honour; I know that a slip of
the tongue is worse than a slip of the foot.”</p>

<p>“You are young to have learnt that lesson;
bear it well in mind. And now you can go.”</p>

<p>Old Ibrahim heard the splendid news that
same night, as he and his adopted grandson sat
on the rug in the middle of the shop, with the
oil-lamp swinging between them; heard it with
puckered face, twitching claw-like fingers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
glittering eyes. What was the store he had
buried beneath the floor in comparison to <i>this</i>?
<i>Two</i> camel-loads of gold and jewels! Oh! if he
had only taken the worthless-looking amulet when
he appropriated the ponies and the money; it
was the richest prize of all; but alas! he was
ever unfortunate.</p>

<p>“Let us go forth and seek it now,” he panted;
“we will arise and take two ekkas with strong
ponies, and spades, and sacks, and start. I will
aver that we are gone to a marriage at Aligarh.”</p>

<p>“You would not be believed,” returned Kareem
scornfully; “and how would you get the ekkas,
or buy spades, without raising suspicion? The
place is full of robbers and budmashes, and the
distance is too long for an old man like you;
we would both be murdered. No, I will wait and
go with the collector sahib; he will lend carts,
and we need have no fear—we shall have the
protection of the Sircar.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, but you are a young man,” whined
Ibrahim, twisting his hands convulsively, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
in two months <i>I</i> may be dead! Oh! and I know
so well where to sell gold and precious stones;
where we shall get a <i>great</i> price quietly, and
without question or dispute.”</p>

<p>“You will surely live two months,” rejoined
Kareem. “At any rate, I have given my word
to the sahib, and it must be as he wills.”</p>

<p>From this time forward, a great change came
over Kareem; he no longer laughed and gesticulated
and showed his teeth—white as the
slit of a cocoanut; he no longer gossiped in the
serai, or gambled below the bridge; he found his
secret very burdensome, and his veins seemed
filled with a burning fever of restlessness; his
eyes looked large and his cheeks hollow; his
song was no longer on his lips.</p>

<p>As for old Ibrahim, he now cared nought for
his trade; and <i>what</i>, asked the neighbours, had he
and Kareem in common that they were so often
together, conferring earnestly in low whispers?</p>

<p>Kareem was much at home, too, and people
began to marvel; he seemed preoccupied and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
strange and proud; he refused to gamble; he took
no interest in kite-flying; instead of which, he
was constantly muttering into the ear of his
grandfather. “Why? What were they talking
about? What was their secret?”</p>

<p>Kareem was recounting the list of spoil for the
hundredth time, and Ibrahim was bestowing much
sage advice on his <i>protégé</i>.</p>

<p>“My son, above all keep the secret from a
woman—from Pera; do not let her mischievous
eyes draw you into her snare. She is bad, she is
insolent to you; may her hair take fire!”</p>

<p>“But you know the proverb, a blow in the
mouth from the hand of her we love is sweeter
than raisins,” argued the youth.</p>

<p>“And you love her?” shrieked the old man.</p>

<p>Kareem nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, ye fathers!” exclaimed Ibrahim; “but
she will marry that budmash Mindoo.”</p>

<p>“She cares not for him, and I shall be rich.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and who has money in the scales, has
strength in his arms. He who has no money is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
destitute of friends. Hearken, my son; Pera will
spend your riches like flowing water.”</p>

<p>“Time enough to talk of spending when I
possess them,” rejoined the lad, prudently.</p>

<p>“Fair son of my old age, give me your promise
to keep the news from her; swear it by the beard
of the Prophet.”</p>

<p>“I swear by the soul of my father; am I a child
or a fool?” he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“Alas! in her hands you are <i>both</i>.”</p>

<p>Kareem’s altered manner was not lost on Pera,
and she smilingly promised her immediate circle to
probe his secret, and that they should all speedily
learn why he gave himself airs like a Nawab.</p>

<p>She drew him on, and encouraged the infatuated
boy, and gained her old ascendency over him in
less than two days. He entirely forgot Ibrahim’s
solemn warnings, and what chance has a wrinkled
ugly old man against the charms and the mocking
words, and bright glances, of a Circe of sixteen?
She asked Kareem many searching questions, and
flouted him, ridiculed him, flattered him. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
evening, as they leant over the bridge together, she
inquired—</p>

<p>“Why had he given away his kite? Why was
he not at Buldoo’s wedding feast? Why did he
mope like a sick fowl? What secret was in his
mind?”</p>

<p>His tardy answers were vague and confused, and
all at once the truth broke upon Pera with one
lightning flash.</p>

<p>The scroll had been deciphered.</p>

<p>“Kareem, I see you no longer care for me,” she
whimpered tearfully.</p>

<p>“I do,” he rejoined; “but to what avail? You
are to marry Mindoo, the dacoit.”</p>

<p>“He is no dacoit; neither am I to marry him.
If you say so, I will strike you on the mouth with
my shoe,” rejoined this fiery lady.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, both my words are true,” persisted
Kareem, doggedly.</p>

<p>“They are <i>not</i>; Mindoo is old. Ah bah! thirty
years old! he lacks one finger; he has a hideous
mark on his cheek, whilst you——” she paused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
and smiled in his face expressively and said, “Oh,
Kareem, what an owl you are! And now shall I
tell you what ails you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you can,” he answered with an incredulous
laugh.</p>

<p>“You have found out what was written in the
little scroll.”</p>

<p>Kareem started perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it is true,” and here she made a
wild shot. “I’ll wager my gold nose-ring, that it
relates to <i>money</i>.”</p>

<p>Kareem grew very pale, and cast down his eyes.</p>

<p>“To a treasure: look at me, Kareem.”</p>

<p>He looked, impelled by the influence of her eyes,
looked and was lost—his face told everything.</p>

<p>“Pera,” he exclaimed tremulously, “you are a
witch.”</p>

<p>“Kareem,” she rejoined, leaning her cool smooth
cheek against his (truly she was a bold, forward
minx), “you are an owl; you always <i>were</i> an owl.
Once you had no secrets from me.—Now begin and
tell me all about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“I can tell you nothing,” withdrawing his eyes
from those dazzling black orbs, and gazing fixedly
into the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kareem, alas! my first word was true,
you no longer care for me;” and her eyes filled with
pure crocodile’s tears.</p>

<p>“I do, I do, beyond any treasure in the world,”
he protested eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes” (so there <i>was</i> a treasure), “but you only
pretend to love me; it is all from the mouth, like
idle words.”</p>

<p>“No, it is from my heart and soul; but you in
your heart care not for me, you care for Mindoo.
You laughed the day I came home in my syce’s
clothes—you laughed when Hiram’s white Arab
nearly killed me.”</p>

<p>“Pooh”—snapping her fingers playfully—“what
is a laugh? I always laugh! See, I still
wear your blue glass bangles. I love finery; I
love laughing—and I love <i>you</i>. Oh, foolish Kareem,
how shall I prove it to you, since you doubt my
word? Speak!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Marry me in two moons’ time,” was his prompt
answer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” after a long pause, “but I must also
prove <i>you</i>; I swear by Allah to marry you, but
first you must tell me your secret.”</p>

<p>And she looked up into his face and smiled, and
he, gazing at her parted red lips and glistening,
eager eyes, wavered. She saw her advantage, and
instantly pressed it home.</p>

<p>Oh! miserable youth! why did you not attend
to that cry of warning in your ears—“Blind man,
blind man, blind man”?</p>

<p>The sun hung low in a crimson sky, everything
was defined and glorified as in a golden light, from
the curves of the shining river, to where the flat
horizon touched the glowing heavens. The couple
on the bridge, fair as another Paul and Virginia,
stood out in black relief against the yellow haze;
as they leant upon the stone parapet, talking in
whispers, passers-by laughed and said, “Behold,
Pera makes a fool of Kareem again.” When at
length they raised themselves up, and came slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
homewards, there was a new, ecstatic, and triumphant
expression in Pera’s eyes—she <span class="allsmcap">KNEW</span>. Nevertheless
she had sworn by a most solemn oath,
never to reveal the secret of the amulet. It was
already arranged that she was to have a palki-gharri
and two horses—just like a <i>mem-sahib</i>—and
a string of large pearls, and gold necklets, such as
would make the Bunnia’s wife poison herself from
envy; for she and Kareem were to be married by
the first moon in December—and to live happy
ever after.</p>

<p>A month later, the collector’s camp was pitched
within two miles of the banks of the Goomptee.
He had arrived there by slow marches, and was
within easy reach of the spot indicated in the
parchment. Mr. Colebrook set out on foot in the
afternoon, with Kareem to carry his fishing-rod, and
to disarm suspicion. They walked for some distance
along the edge of the river in single file, till
round a sharp bend the old broken bridge appeared
in view; the setting sun was shining between the
massive piers, as the Goomptee came swirling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
between them. A pair of paddy-birds were having
a mortal combat in the rushes, a serious-looking
blue kingfisher was perched on a stone, following
his avocation. Enormous fish (<i>rohu</i>) splashed
about like porpoises; no wonder they were so
thriving! the Goomptee is a sacred river; on the
sand on the far bank lay a bleached white skeleton,
and here, among the tangled water-plants, was an
old charpoy, legs upward, on which some corpse
had once been committed to the holy stream.</p>

<p>But naturally Kareem had no interest in these
things; though his master, a man of dreamy
moods, paused for a moment, and in his mind’s
eye surveyed the great bridge as it once had been,
covered with a multitude of horsemen and camel-drivers—a
predatory horde—flying northward, with
their spoils, and their streaming horse-tail standards.</p>

<p>He was sharply aroused from his reverie by a
piercing cry, and turning, he saw that Kareem
had already made his way to the great milestone
(shaped like a gigantic thimble); there, too, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
an ancient saal tree; and his treasure-seeking
syce was standing on the verge of an enormous,
recently dug, and perfectly empty hole. Miserable
Kareem, the world seemed to swim before his
eyes; the tree, the milestone, and the sky went
round and round, as he turned a ghastly face and
pair of wild eyes on his master, and pointed to
the cavity at his feet; it was all that he could do.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Mr. Colebrook, “it is gone, no
doubt of <i>that</i>, and gone within a week; see the
freshly-turned earth, the wheel-tracks. Oh, you
young fool! How many have you taken into your
confidence besides old Ibrahim? You see they
have robbed you. Whom have you told?”</p>

<p>“But one,” stammered Kareem, in a hoarse
voice.</p>

<p>“Look,” continued the collector, “they were in
a great hurry”—poking the earth with his stick
as he spoke. “See, they left the spade; here are
bits of iron clamps; here are two gold coins, the boss
of a silver bit, and—yes, a trace of the thieves—and
of course there was a <i>woman</i> in it,” as, stooping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
he picked up something, and held it towards
Kareem. “Here is half of a blue glass bangle.”</p>

<p>Kareem stared, with great distended eyes; as he
stood, he became of a dull greyish colour, his lips
were livid, and his face twisted out of all recognition,
with some spasm of horrible agony.</p>

<p>“<i>It is Pera’s</i>,” he shouted, with a wild, despairing
scream, and flung himself full-length on the
ground, digging his hands into the sandy soil.</p>

<p>“They have a whole week’s start, I am afraid,”
said Mr. Colebrook, who was still turning over the
earth, “and will make forced marches; but we
may catch them. I shall send you off at once, on
the young bay horse, with a note to the joint
magistrate; he will telegraph, and I believe we
will get them yet; they have too heavy a load to
travel rapidly. Kareem, don’t be a woman! Get
up and listen to me, Kareem! Do you hear
me?” and he shook him gently. But Kareem
would never hear anything again in this world—Kareem
was dead.</p>

<p>At first Mr. Colebrook could not, and would not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
realize the truth; he put his hand across the cold
mouth; he laid his ear against the still heart; it
was no faint. Alas! no.</p>

<p>The shock had proved fatal to Kareem. To lose
his fortune and his beloved, in one and the same
moment, was too crushing a blow for his frail
organization. Pera’s treachery had broken his
heart.</p>

<p>When the collector had at last grasped the
tragic fact, that the active, bright-faced boy, who
had started from the camp hardly an hour ago,
full of life and hope, was really dead, he was
deeply concerned, and he felt an unusual dimness
in his eyes, as he stood gazing at this unhappy
heir of long-buried riches.</p>

<p>Then seeing a chuprassi in the distance, who
had followed (unbidden) afar off, he shouted to him
to approach. The chuprassi came and looked,
and was amazed out of his usual impassive demeanour;
and in an extraordinarily short time a
little crowd had assembled—what mystic force is
it that draws people to a tragedy, whether in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
London street, or an Indian jungle? Here were
lean brown fishermen from the river-banks; here
were turtle-spearers, and half a dozen ryots, who
had abandoned their herds of gaunt white cattle—all
come to look at a dead lad.</p>

<p>The distance made it impossible to carry Kareem
back to Hassanpur, and bury him formally
in the Mohammedan cemetery. “In the place
where the tree falleth there shall it be,” and he
must find a resting-place in the forest. Mr. Colebrook
left two men to watch the body, whilst
he hurried to camp to make arrangements for
the interment, and to break the heavy tidings to
Harry Sahib. The funeral obsequies were solemnly
conducted by Kareem’s fellow Mohammedan servants,
and early next day the collector was
surprised to hear that Kareem had already been
laid to rest. The great hole, which for three
centuries had contained his lost family treasure,
of gold and rubies, pearls and emeralds, now
received instead, their unfortunate and defrauded
heir,—and proved his convenient grave. Harry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Sahib shed many hot tears upon it, and even
brought the “lal Tattoo” to see the place where
poor Kareem was buried.</p>

<p>The collector instituted an immediate search for
Pera, daughter of Abdool, but she and Mindoo, the
dacoit, had suddenly disappeared—“the very day
that his honour himself had gone into the district;
no one could tell what had become of them.”
After a long and wholly useless investigation, the
following facts were elicited: Pera and Mindoo
had had accomplices in their flight; they had
gone south; but few beyond Mr. Colebrook were in
possession of the third and most important detail,
viz. that with them, they had carried the secret of
the amulet.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
